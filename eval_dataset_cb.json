Therefore, OSHA has \nfinalized                                           this provision as it was                                            \nproposed. The Panel recommends that OSHA solicit   In the discussion of proposed   public comment on \nmaking it clear        Sec.   1926.1427(h)(1), OSHA   that: (1) An employer is permitted to    requested \npublic comment on  equip its cranes with manuals re-        this issue. Based on the  written in a way that \nwould allow an     analysis of the comments   operator with a low literacy level to    received, OSHA \nconcludes that  understand the material (such as         these manuals may not be re -  substituting some \ntext with pictures     written as recommended because   and illustrations), and (2) making it    it could \ncause information  clear that, when the cranes are          i mportant for safety to be   equipped with \nsuch re-written manuals    omitted.   and materials, the \"manuals\" and   \"materials\" referred to in these   \nliteracy provisions would be the re-  written manuals. The Panel recommends that OSHA explain   OSHA will \nissue a Small   in a Small Business Compliance Guide     Business Compliance Guide   that the \ncertification/qualification     after the final rule is   test does not need to be administered    issued, and \nwill explain these   in English but can be administered in    points in the Guide.   a language that the \ncandidate can  read; and that while the employee  would also need to have a sufficient  level of literacy to \nread and   understand the relevant information in   the equipment manual, that requirement   would be \nsatisfied if the material is  written in a language that the  employee can read and understand. ------------------\n------------------------------------------------------      In addition to these issues brou ght up by the SBREFA panel, \nSBA's  office of Advocacy provided a set of recommendations for OSHA to  consider. (ID-0147.) These \nrecommendations and OSHA's responses to them  are summarized as follows:     1. \"OSHA should consider \neliminating the requirement for third- party certification of crane operators--at least for some small cranes  or \nroutine lifts.\" OSHA carefully examined this requirement. As noted  in the benefits sections, broadly speaking, \nsuch a requirement resulted  in major reductions in crane fatalities in both Ontario and California.  Further, \nas discussed in the preamble sections, there is no easy way,  beyond that already allowed, to eliminate third-\nparty certification.      2. \"OSHA should exempt equipment used solely to deliver materials  to a \nconstruction site by placing or staking the materials on the  ground.\" OSHA has clearly exempted such \nactivities from the scope of  the final standard.     3. \"OSHA should clarify the meaning of 'construction'.\" \nAs noted  above, OSHA has added materi al designed to aid in this distinction.  However, the definition of \nconstruction is not an issue in this  rulemaking, but is instead an issue for all construction rules.     4. \"OSHA \nshould further limit the 'controlling entity' provisions  in the proposed rule.\" Advocacy was concerned that \nsmall businesses  may not be onsite, or may not have suitable expertise to meet the  requirements for \ncontrolling entities. However, the fact remains that  only the controlling entity can do what this section of the \nstandard  requires: (1) Transfer any information they know of to the crane  operator; and (2) authorize action \nthat will change ground conditions  to assure they are suitable for crane operations. The controlling  entity \ncould, of course, authorize the crane operator to alter site  conditions as they wished to assure adequate \nsafety--but it is the  controlling entity and not the crane operator that inevitably has  responsibility for site \nconditions.     5. \"OSHA should not mandate that employers follow manufacturers'  recommendations.\" \nAdvocacy's concern here was that manufacturers may  unduly limit crane operations out of liability concerns. \nHowever, only  the manufacturers know the limitations of the cranes they produce. As a  result, OSHA has \nretained these provisions. If Advocacy had provided  examples of clearly unnecessary provisions in manuals, \ntheir argument  might have been more convincing. In the absence of even a single  example, there seems no",

The range of the boom must be  limited at the minimum and maximum radius. \nTemporary alternative  measures: Clearly mark the cable (so it can be seen by the operator) at  a point that \nwill give the operator sufficient time to stop the boom  hoist within the minimum and maximum boom radius, \nor use a spotter who  is in direct communication with the operator to inform the operator  when this point \nis reached.      (iii) Anti two -blocking device. The tower crane must be equipped  with a device which \nautomatically prevents damage from contact between  the load block, overhaul ball, or similar component, \nand the boom tip  (or fixed upper block or similar component). The device(s) must prevent  such damage at \nall points where two-blocking could occur.

Temporary  alternative measures: Mark the cable (so it can be seen by the  operator) \nat a point that will give the operator sufficient time to  stop the hoist prior to last 2 wraps of hoist cable being \nspooled off  the drum, or use a spotter who is in direct communication with the  operator to inform the \noperator when this point is reached     (v) Load moment limiting device. The tower crane must have a device  \nthat prevents moment overloading. Temporary alternative measures: A  radius indicating device must be used \n(if the tower crane is not  equipped with a radius indicating device, the radius must be measured  to ensure \nthe load is within the rated c apacity of the crane). In  addition, the weight of the load must be determined \nfrom a source  recognized by the industry (such as the load's manufacturer), or by a  calculation method \nrecognized by the industry (such as calculating a  steel beam from measured dimensions and a known per foot \nweight), or by  other equally reliable means. This information must be provided to the  operator prior to the \nlift.     (vi) Hoist line pull limiting device. The capacity of the hoist  must be limited to prevent overloading, \nincluding each individual gear  ratio if equipped with a multiple speed hoist transmission. Temporary  \nalternative measures: The operator must ensure that the weight of the  load does not exceed the capacity of \nthe hoist (including for each  individual gear ratio if equipped with a multiple speed hoist  transmission).     \n(vii) Rail travel limiting device. The travel distance in each  direction must be limited to prevent the travel \nbogies from running  into the end stops or buffers. Temporary alternative measures: A  spotter who is in \ndirect communication with the operator must be used  when operations are conducted within 10 feet of \neither end of the  travel rail end stops; the spotter must inform the operator of the  distance of the travel \nbogies from the end stops or buffers.      (viii) Boom hoist drum positive locking device and control. The  \nboom hoist drum must be equipped with a control that will enable the  operator to positively lock the boom \nhoist drum from the cab. Temporary  alternative measures: The device must be manually set when required \nif  an electric, hydraulic or automatic control is not functioning.      (6) Category I I operational aids and \nalternative measures.  Operational aids listed in this paragraph that are not working properly  must be \nrepaired no later than 30 calendar days after the deficiency  occurs. Exception: If the employer documents \nthat it has ordered the  necessary parts within 7 calendar days of the occurrence of the  deficiency, and the \npart is not received in time to complete the repair  in 30 calendar days, the repair must be completed within \n7 calendar  days of receipt of the parts.

(b) Preventing en croachment/electrocution. Where encroachment  \nprecautions are required under Option (2), or Option (3) of this  section, all of the following requirements \nmust be met:     (1) Conduct a planning meeting with the Assembly/Disassembly  director (A/D director), \noperator, assembly/disassembly crew and the  other workers who will be in the assembly/disassembly area \nto review  the location of the power line(s) and the steps that will be  implemented to prevent \nencroachment/electrocution.     (2) If tag lines are used, they must be nonconductive.     (3) At least one \nof the following additional measures must be in  place. The measure selected from this list must be effective \nin  preventing encroachment.     The additional measures are:      (i) Use a dedicated spott er who is in \ncontinuous contact with the  equipment operator. The dedicated spotter must:     (A) Be equipped with a \nvisual aid to assist in identifying the  minimum clearance distance. Examples of a visual aid include, but are  \nnot limited to: A clearly visible line painted on the ground; a clearly  visible line of stanchions; a set of clearly \nvisible line-of-sight  landmarks (such as a fence post behind the dedicated spotter and a  building corner \nahead of the dedicated spotter).      (B) Be positioned to effectively gauge the clearance distance.      (C) \nWhere necessary, use equipment that enables the dedicated  spotter to communicate directly with the \noperator.

(2) The \nclearances specified in Table T of this section are  maintained.     (3) The effects of speed and terr ain on \nequipment movement  (including movement of the boom/mast) are considered so that those  effects do not \ncause the minimum clearance distances specified in Table  T of this section to be breached.     (4) Dedicated \nspotter. If any part of the equipmen t while traveling  will get closer than 20 feet to the power line, the \nemployer must  ensure that a dedicated spotter who is in continuous contact with the  driver/operator is \nused. The dedicated spotter must:     (i) Be positioned to effectively gauge the clearance distance.     (ii) \nWhere necessary, use equipment that enables the dedicated  spotter to communicate directly with the \noperator.     (iii) Give timely information to the operator so that the required  clearance distance can be \nmaintained.     (5) Additional precautions for traveling in poor visibility. When  traveling at night, or in \nconditions of poor visibility, in addition to  the measures specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this  \nsection, the employer must ensure that:      (i) The power lines are illuminated or another means of \nidentifying  the location of the lines is used.

(d) Equipment criteria.     (1) Capacity: Use of suspended personnel platforms. The total \nload  (with the platform loaded, including the hook, load line and rigging)  must not exceed 50 percent of \nthe rated capacity for the radius and  configuration of the equipment, except during proof testing.      (2) \nCapacity: Use of boom-attached personnel platforms. The total  weight of the loaded personnel platform must \nnot exceed 50 percent of  the rated capacity for the radius and configuration of the equipment  (except \nduring proof testing).      (3) Capacity: Hoisting personnel without a personnel platform. When  hoisting \npersonnel without a personnel platform pursuant to paragraph  (b)(2) of this section, the total load (including \nthe hook, load line,  rigging and any other equipment that imposes a load) must not exceed 50  percent of \nthe rated capacity for the radius and configuration of the  equipment, except during proof testing.     (4) \nWhen the occupied personnel platform is in a stationary working  position, the load and boom hoist brakes, \nswing brakes, and operator  actuated secondary braking and locking features (such as pawls or dogs)  or \nautomatic secondary brakes must be engaged.      (5) Devices.     (i) Equipment (except for derricks and \narticulating cranes) with a  variable angle boom must be equipped with all of the following:     (A) A boom \nangle indicator, readily visible to the operator, and     (B) A boom hoist limiting device.     (ii) Articulating \ncranes must be equipped with a properly  functioning automatic overload protect ion device.      (iii) \nEquipment with a luffing jib must be equipped with:     (A) A jib angle indicator, readily visible to the operator, \nand.     (B) A jib hoist limiting device.     (iv) Equipment with telescoping booms must be equipped with a  \ndevice to indicate the boom's extended length clearly to the operator,  or must have measuring marks on the \nboom.     (v) Anti two-block. A device which automatically prevents damage  and load failure from contact \nbetween the load block, overhaul ball, or  similar component, and the boom tip (or fixed upper block or similar  \ncomponent) must be used. The device(s) must prevent such damage/failure  at all points where two-blocking \ncould occur. Exception: This device is  not required when hoisting personnel in pile driving operations.  \nInstead, paragraph (p)(2) of this section specifies how to prevent two- blocking during such operations.     (vi) \nControlled load lowering. The load line hoist drum must have a  system, other than the load line hoist brake, \nwhich regulates the  lowering rate of speed of the hoist mechanism. This system or device  must be used \nwhen hoisting personnel.      Note: Free fall of the load line hoist is prohibited (see Sec.   1926.1426(d); \nthe use of equipment in which the boom hoist mechanism  can free fall is also prohibited (see Sec.  \n1926.1426(a)(1).      (vii) Proper operation required. Personnel hoisting operations must  not begin unless \nthe devices listed in this section are in proper  working order. If a device stops working properly during such  \noperations, the operator must safely stop operations. Personnel  hoisting operations must not resume until \nthe device is again working  properly. Alternative measures are not permitted. (See Sec.  1926.1417  for \ntag-out and related requirements.)      (6) Direct attachment of a personnel platform to a luffing jib is  \nprohibited.

See Sec.  1926.1402(f).    Sec.  1926.1401  Definitions.       A/D \ndirector (Assembly/Disassembly director) means an individual  who meets this subpart's requirements for an \nA/D director, irrespective  of the person's formal job title or whether the person is non - management or \nmanagement personnel.     Articulating crane means a crane whose boom consists of a series of  folding, \npin connected structural members, t ypically manipulated to  extend or retract by power from hydraulic \ncylinders.     Assembly/Disassembly means the assembly and/or disassembly of  equipment covered under \nthis standard. With regard to tower cranes,  \"erecting and climbing\" replaces the term \"assembly,\" and  \n\"dismantling\" replaces the term \"disassembly.\" Regardless of  whether the crane is initially erected to its full \nheight or is climbed  in stages, the process of increasing the height of the crane is an  erection process.     \nAssist crane means a crane used to assist in assembling or  disassembling a crane.     Attachments means \nany device that expands the range of tasks that  can be done by the equipment. Examples include, but are not \nlimited to:  An auger, drill, magnet, pile-driver, and boom-attached personnel  platform.     Audible signal \nmeans a signal made by a distinct sound or series of  sounds. Examples include, but are not limited to, sounds \nmade by a  bell, horn, or whistle.      Blocking (also referred to as \"cribbing\") is wood or other  material \nused to support equipment or a component and distribute loads  to the ground. It is typically used to support \nlattice boom sections  during assembly/disassembly and under outrigger an d stabilizer floats.      \nBoatswain's chair means a single-point adjustable suspension  scaffold consisting of a seat or sling (which may \nbe incorporated into  a full body harness) designed to support one employee in a sitting  position.     \nBogie means \"travel bogie,\" which is defined below.     Boom (equipment other than tower crane) means an \ninclined spar,  strut, or other long structural member which supports the upper  hoisting tackle on a crane or \nderrick. Typically, the length and  vertical angle of t he boom can be varied to achieve increased height or  \nheight and reach when lifting loads. Booms can usually be grouped into  general categories of hydraulically \nextendible, cantilevered type,  latticed section, cable supported type or articulating type.     Boom (tower \ncranes): On tower cranes, if the \"boom\" (i.e.,  principal horizontal structure) is fixed, it is referred to as a jib;  \nif it is moveable up and down, it is referred to as a boom.      Boom angle indicator means a device which \nmeasures the angle of the  boom relative to horizontal.     Boom hoist limiting device includes boom hoist \ndisengaging device,  boom hoist shut-off, boom hoist disconnect, boom hoist hydraulic  relief, boom hoist \nkick-outs, automatic boom stop device, or derricking  limiter. This type of device disengages boom hoist power \nwhen the boom  reaches a predetermined operating angle. It also sets brakes or closes  valves to prevent \nthe boom from lowering after power is disengaged.",

The A/D \ndirector's  plan is to keep the boom sections stable while they are lowered into  place by attaching the assist \ncrane hoist line ab ove the center of  gravity of each section. However, in assembling the non -symmetrical  \ntop section of the boom, the A/D director is not able to determine  where to attach the assist crane hoist line \nso that it is above the  center of gravity. In this situation, before raising the section,  all personnel are kept \nclear of the section and the section is first  raised a few inches to determine whether it tips when raised (if it  \ndid tip, it would indicate it is not rigged over the center of  gravity). If this occurs, the hoist line is repositioned \nand the  procedure repeated (with employees kept clear of the section while  it is raised) until the A/D \ndirector determines that it is rigged  over the center of gravity and can be moved into place without  \ndangerous movement.

(3) If a deficiency is identified, an immediate determination must  be made by the qualified \nperson as to whether the deficiency  constitutes a safety hazard.     (i) If the deficiency is determined to \nconstitute a safety hazard,  operations involving use of the wire rope in question must be  prohibited until:     \n(A) The wire rope is replaced (see Sec.  1926.1417), or      (B) If the deficiency is localized, the problem is \ncorrected by  severing the wire rope in two; the undamaged portion may continue to be  used. Joining \nlengths of wire rope by splicing is prohibited. If a rope  is shortened under this paragraph, the employer must \nensure that the  drum will still have two wraps of wire when the load and/or boom is in  its lowest position.     \n(ii) If the qualified person determines that, though not presently  a safety hazard, the deficiency needs to be \nmonitored, the employer  must ensure that the deficiency is checked in the monthly inspections.     (4) The \ninspection must be documented according to Sec.   1926.1412(f)(7) (annual/comprehensive inspection \ndocumentation).

(a) Original equipment wire rope and replacement wire rope must be  \nselected and installed in accordance with the requirements of this  section. Selection of replacement wire \nrope must be in accordance with  the recommendations of the wire rope manufacturer, the equipment  \nmanufacturer, or a qualified person.      (b) Wire rope de sign criteria: Wire rope (other than rotation  \nresistant rope) must comply with either Option (1) or Option (2) of  this section, as follows:     (1) Option \n(1). Wire rope must comply with section 5 -1.7.1 of ASME  B30.5-2004 (incorporated by reference, see  Sec.  \n1926.6) except that  section's paragraph (c) must not apply.     (2) Option (2). Wire rope must be designed \nto have, in relation to  the equipment's rated capacity, a sufficient minimum breaking force and  design factor \nso that compliance with the applicable inspection  provisions in Sec.  1926.1413 will be an effective means \nof preventing  sudden rope failure.     (c) Wire rope must be compatible with the safe functioning of the  \nequipment.     (d) Boom hoist reeving.     (1) Fiber core ropes must not be used for boom hoist reeving,  \nexcept for derricks.

(ID-0419.1.) Cities and localities, however, have no authority  under the Act to submit a State \nplan. Only a State itself may submit a plan  and that plan must apply throughout the State. (ID-0419.1.) There \nwas no  majority consensus in Gade as to the preemptive effect of an OSHA standard  on supplementary \nlaws not addressed by sec. 18.     A variety of factors support the view that building codes are not  the type \nof laws Congress intended to preempt in enacting sec. 18.  There is legislative history supporting this \nconclusion. Representative  Steiger, a primary sponsor of the Act, indicated that the Act would not  be \npreemptive in the event of an overlap between an OSHA standard and a  local building code. (ID-0419.1.) The \nSecretary has interpreted the Act  as not preempting laws such as building codes and OSHA rulemaking has  \nlong proceeded on the assumption that local building codes exist in  parallel to OSHA regulations and are not \npreempted by them. For  example, in the preamble to the final rule on Exit Routes, Emergency  Action Plans, \nand Fire Prevention Plans, OSHA commended the  effectiveness of building codes while declining to recognize \ncompliance  with building codes as compliance with the OSHA standard (67 FR 67950,  67954, Nov. 7, 2002). \nStrong policy considerations bolster this  understanding. Work practices and conditions pose a variety of \nserious  hazards to the public, and local jurisdictions have enacted a network  of industrial codes, such as \nbuilding and electrical codes, that touch  on issues for which there are OSHA standards. If New York City's \ncrane  ordinances are preempted because of their incidental impact on worker  safety, building and electrical \ncodes, and many other types of local  regulation will also be in jeopardy. The text and history of the Act  give \nno indication that Congress intended such a sweeping preemptive  effect. (ID-0419.1.)     A separate reason \nfor concluding that New York City's crane laws  are not preempted is that they are laws of general applicability. \nThe  Gade plurality stated that laws of general applicability, such as  traffic or fire safety laws, that regulate \nthe conduct of workers and  nonworkers as members of the general public would not be preempted  \nregardless of their substantial effect on worker safety. 505 U.S. at  107.     The New York City crane \nordinances are not designed to protect  workers as a class; they regulate crane operations only to the extent  \nthey pose a hazard to the public. The effect of the ordinances is to  protect a group far larger than employees \non a construction site.  Cranes operate in some of the most densely populated areas of the city.  (ID-0404.1; \n-0342.) This density makes it generally impossible to  locate a crane or derrick so that it will not operate over \nor adjacent  to crowded streets, sidewalks and occupied buildings. Id. For the same  reason, mobile cranes, \nwhich can have booms hundreds of feet in length,  must park on and operate from, the street. Id. On any given \nday, more  than 300 cranes, including 30-40 tower cranes, operate in New York  City.\\144\\ Id. A recent study \nconcluded that a tower crane operating in  NYC poses a risk to 12 to 15 surrounding buildings, several streets,  \nand 1,000-1,500 people. Id. A crane accident on March 15, 2008 killed a  woman in a brownstone one block \naway, destroyed eighteen buildings and  damaged many more within a several -block radius, and forced \nhundreds of  people from their homes. Id. Twelve members of the public were injured  in crane accidents \nbetween 2006 and 200 8. Id. Although compliance with  the City's ordinances will unquestionably protect \nworkers, such  protection is incidental to protection of all persons in the vicinity  regardless of their status as \nemployees or non -employees.",

(B) Hammerhead \ntower cranes manufactured after November 8, 2011  must have a hook radius indicator readable from the \noperator's station.     (C) Temporary alternative measures: Hook radii or boom angle must  be determined \nby measuring the hook radii or boom angle with a  measuring device.     (ii) Trolley travel deceleration \ndevice. The trolley speed must be  automatically reduced prior to the trolley reaching the end limit in  both \ndirections. Temporary alternative measure: The employer must post  a notice in the cab of the crane notifying \nthe operator that the  trolley travel deceleration device is malfunctioning and instructing  the operator to \ntake special care to reduce the trolley speed when  approaching the trolley end limits.     (iii) Boom hoist \ndeceleration device. The boom speed m ust be  automatically reduced prior to the boom reaching the \nminimum or maximum  radius limit. Temporary alternative measure: The employer must post a  notice in \nthe cab of the crane notifying the operator that the boom  hoist deceleration device is malfun ctioning and \ninstructing the  operator to take special care to reduce the boom speed when approaching  the minimum or \nmaximum radius limits.      (iv) Load hoist deceleration device. The load speed must be  automatically \nreduced prior to the hoist reaching the upper limit.  Temporary alternative measure: The employer must post \na notice in the  cab of the crane notifying the operator that the load hoist  deceleration device is \nmalfunctioning and instructing the operator to  take special care to reduce the load speed when approaching \nthe upper  limits.     (v) Wind speed indicator. A device must be provided to display the  wind speed and \nmust be mounted above the upper rotating structure on  tower cranes. On self erecting cranes, it must be \nmounted at or above  the jib level. Temporary alternative measures: Use of wind speed  information from a \nproperly functioning indicating device on another  tower crane on the same site, or a qualified person \nestimates the wind  speed.     (vi) Load indicating device. Cranes manufactured after November 8,  2011 \nmust have a device that displays the magnitude of the load on the  hook. Displays that are part of load moment \nlimiting devices that  display the load on the hook meet this requirement. Temporary  alternative measures: \nThe weight of the load must be determined from a  source recognized by the industry (such as the load's \nmanufacturer), or  by a calculation method recognized by the industry (such as calculating  a steel beam from \nmeasured dimensions and a known per foot weight), or  by other equally reliable means. This information \nmust be provided to the  operator prior to the lift.      (f) Inspections.      (1) Section 1926.1412 \n(Inspections) applies to tower cranes, except  that the term \"assembly\" is replaced by \"erection.\" Section  \n1926.1413 (Wire rope--inspection) applies to tower cranes.     (2) Pre-erection inspection. Before each crane \ncomponent is  erected, it must be inspected by a qualified person for damage or  excessive wear.     (i) \nThe qualified person must pay particular attention to  components that will be difficult to inspect thoroughly \nduring shift  inspections.     (ii) If the qualified person determines that a component is damaged  or worn \nto the extent that it would create a safety hazard if used on  the crane, that component must not be erected \non the crane unless it is  repaired and, upon reinspection by the qualified person, found to no  longer create \na safety hazard.     (iii) If the qualified person determines that, though not presently  a safety hazard, the \ncomponent needs to be monitored, the employer must  ensure that the component is checked in the monthly \ninspections. Any  such determination must be documented,  and the documentation must be  available to \nany individual who conducts a monthly inspection.      (3) Post -erection inspection. In addition to the \nrequirements in  Sec.  1926.1412(c), the following requirements must be met:      (i) A load test using \ncertified weights, or scaled weights using a  certified scale with a current certificate of calibration, must be  \nconducted after each erection.

BILLING CODE 4510-\n26-P  Appendix A to Subpart CC of Part 1926 --Standard Hand Signals  BILLING CODE 4510-26-C  Appendix \nA to Subpart CC of Part 1926 --Standard Hand Signals   Appendix B to Subpart CC of Part 1926 --\nAssembly/Disassembly: Sample  Procedures for Minimizing the Risk of Unintended Dangerous Boom  \nMovement      1. Section 1926.1404(f)(1) provides that when pins (or similar  devices) are being removed, \nemployees must not be under the boom,  jib, or other components, except where the requirements of Sec.   \n1926.1404(f)(2) are met. The exception in Sec.  1926.1404(f)(2)  applies when the employer demonstrates \nthat site constraints require  one or more employees to be under the boom, jib, or other components  when \npins (or similar devices) are being removed. In such a  situation, the A/D director must implement procedures \nthat minimize  the risk of unintended dan gerous movement and minimize the duration  and extent of \nexposure under the boom.     The following scenario is an example of how the exception  applies: A boom \ncannot be disassembled on the ground because of  aboveground piping (as might be found, for exa mple, in \nan oil  refinery) that precludes lowering the boom to the ground. The boom  must therefore be disassembled \nin the air, and the employees who  remove the pins must perform that work from an aerial lift whose  base \nis positioned on one side (the near side) of the boom. To gain  access to the pins on the far side, the aerial lift \nbasket must move  under the boom, since, due to lack of room, the aerial lift cannot  be repositioned on the \nfar side. Due to lack of room, the aerial  lift cannot be repositioned on the far side, so the aerial basket  must \nmove under the boom to gain access to the pins on the far side.      To minimize the risk of unintended \ndangerous movement while the  pins are removed, the A/D director uses an assist crane that is  rigged to \nsupport the boom section that is being detached, using  particular care to ensure that the section end that is \nnear the  employee(s) removing the pins is well supported. The duratio n and  extent of exposure is \nminimized by removing the far side pins first,  moving the aerial lift basket as soon as possible to the near side  \nso that the employees are no longer under the boom, and then  removing the near side pins.     2. Section \n1926.1404(h)(6)(i) provides that, during assembly/  disassembly, the center of gravity of the load must be \nidentified if  that is necessary for the method used for maintaining stability.",

In accordance with the  requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of \n1995 (PRA -95) (44 U.S.C.  3506(c)(2)), the proposed regulation solicited comments on the  information \ncollection included in the proposal. The Department also  submitted an information collection request (ICR), \ntitled \"Cranes and  Derricks in Construction (29 CFR part 1926 subpart CC),\" to OMB for  review in accordance \nwith 44 U.S.C. 3507(d) on the date the proposed  regulation was published.  On January 8, 2009, OMB \ninformed the  Department of Labor to use OMB control number 1218-0261 in future  submissions involving \nthis rulemaking. OMB also commented, \"This OMB  action is not an approval to conduct or sponsor an \ninformation  collection under  the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.\"      OSHA received no public \ncomments that addressed specifically the  paperwork burden analysis of the information collections. A \nnumber of  comments, described earlier in this preamble, contained information  relevant to the costs and \nburden hours attendant to the non -paperwork  provisions of the proposal, which OSHA considered when it \ndeveloped the  revised burden analysis for the ICR associated with this final rule.     Prior to publishing this \nfinal rulemaking, the Department of Labor  submitted the Cranes and Derricks ICR to OMB for OMB approval. \nOSHA  will publish a separate notice in the Federal Register that will  announce the results of that review and \ninclude any applicable OMB  control number. That notice also will include a summary of the  information \ncollection requirements and burdens imposed by the new  standard. A copy of the ICR is available as an exhibit \nat  http://www.regulations.gov. The Department of Labor notes  that a Federal agency cannot c onduct or \nsponsor a collection of  information unless it is approved by OMB under the PRA, and displays  a currently \nvalid OMB control number. Also, notwithstanding any other  provision of law, no employer shall be subject to \npenalty for failing  to comply with a collection of information if the collection of information  does not display \na currently valid OMB control number.     The final Cranes and Derricks standard imposes new information- \ncollection requirements for purposes of PRA -95. These provisions are  necessary to protect the health and \nsafety of employees who work with  equipment at construction worksites. The paperwork requirements \nimpose  on employers a duty to produce and maintain records when they implement  controls and take other \nmeasures to protect workers from hazards  related to cranes and derricks used in construction. For example, \neach  construction business that has workers who operate or are in the  vicinity of cranes and derricks must \nhave, as applicable, the following  documents on f ile and available at the job site: Equipment ratings,  \nemployee training records, written authorizations from qualified  individuals, and qualification program audits. \nDuring an inspection,  OSHA must have access to these records to determine compliance under  conditions \nspecified by the final standard. An employer's failure to  generate and disclose the information required by \nthis standard will  have a substantial affect on the Agency's effort to control and reduce  injuries and fatalities \nrelated to the use of cranes and derricks in  construction.  D. Federalism      The Agency reviewed this \nfinal rule according to the most recent  Executive Order (\"E.O.\") on Federalism (E.O. 13132, 64 FR 43225, Aug.  \n10, 1994). This E.O. requires that Federal agencies, to the extent  possible, refrain from limiting State or local \npolicy options, consult  with States before taking actions that restrict State or local policy  options, and take \nsuch actions only when clear constitutional authority  exists, and the problem is national in scope. The E.O. \nallows Federal  agencies to preempt State and local law only with the expressed consent  of Congress. In \nsuch cases, Federal agencies must limit preemption of  State and local law to the extent possible.     Under \nsection 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970  (\"OSH Act\"; 29 U.S.C. 667), Congress expressly \nprovides that States  may adopt, with Federal approval, a plan for the development and  enforcement of",

As discussed above in section  V.B of this preamble \n(\"Summary of the Final Economic Analysis, and  Regulatory Flexibility Analysis\"), the Agency estimates that  \ncompliance with this rule will require private -sector employers to  expend about $154.1 million each year. \nHowever, while this rule  establishes a Federal mandate in the private sector, the Agency's  standards do not \napply to State, local, or Tribal governments except in  States that have elected voluntarily to adopt a State Plan \napproved by  the Agency. Consequently, this final rule does not meet the definition  of a \"Federal \nintergovernmental mandate\" (see sec. 421(5) of the UMRA  (2 U.S.C. 658(5))). However, the rule imposes costs \nof over $100  million per year on the private sector, and is thus subject to the  requirement under UMRA for \nreview of private sector costs. That  requirement is met in section V.B. of the preamble.  G. Applicability of \nExisting Consensus Standards       Some of the types of equipment subject to this final standard are  \naddressed by current national con sensus standards in the ASME B30  series, including: ASME B30.5 -2004, \n\"Mobile and Locomotive Cranes\";  ASME B30.6 -2003, \"Derricks\"; ASME B30.8 -2004, \"Floating Cranes and  \nFloating Derricks\"; ASME B30.3 -2004, \"Construction Tower Cranes\";  ASME B30.14 -2004, \"Side Boom \nTractors\"; and ASME B30.2 -2001,  \"Overhead and Gantry Cranes.\" In addition, ASME B30.7 -2005, \"Base - \nMounted Drum Hoists,\" addresses a type of equipment that is often a  component of derricks, and ASME \nB30.23-2005, \"Personnel Lifting  Systems,\" addresses issues that are covered by Sec.  1926.1431,  Hoisting \npersonnel.     The Committee consulted these ASME standards (or the most current  versions available at \nthe time) and other resources in developing its  proposal. In most instances, the ASME standards that the \nCommittee  consulted were entered into the docket, including: ASME B30.5-2000  (OSHA-S030-2006-0663-\n0334); ASME B30.5a-2002 Addenda (OSHA-S030-2006- 0663-0335); ASME B30.6-2003 (OSHA-S030-2006-0663-\n0337); ASME B30.17 - 2003 (OSHA-S030-2006-0663-0338); ASME B30.3 -1996 (OSHA-S030-2006-0663- 0353); \nand ASME B30.23 -1998 (OSHA-S030-2006-0663-0354). When newer  versions of the ASME standards were \nissued after the Committee finished  its work, OSHA examined t he updated standards to determine if the  \nprovisions of the updated standards deviated in a significant way from  provisions on which the Committee \nrelied. OSHA entered the updated  standards into the record of this rulemaking. For the most part, OSHA  did \nnot find significant deviations between the updated versions and  the versions reviewed by the Committee. \nIn the few instances in which  deviations occurred, OSHA identified those deviations and asked for  public \ncomment on any issues raised.     As discussed in detail in the Summary and Explanation of the  standard, \na number of provisions in this final rule contain concepts  that are similar to the concepts underlying the \nvarious ASME standards.  However, the Committee determined that, in most instances, the wording  of the \nprovisions in these ASME standards needed revision to improve  the enforceability, clarity, and ease of use.     \nFor some issues, the ASME standards do not address issues covered  by this final rule, or the Committee \ndetermined that a d ifferent  approach was necessary.

The Agency has estimated the additional annualized costs for \ncrane  operator certification to be about $51 million annually--about one- third of the estimated total costs of \nthe final standard. Dropping this  requirement would reduce costs and impacts by that amount, roughly.  \nWithout a Federal regulatory requirement, the level of operator  certification would be uncertain. A \nsubstantial percentage of operators  have already been certified. The Agency is convinced that certification  \nsignificantly improves the safe practices of cra ne operators, and that  increased protection has been the \nexperience in several venues where  certification has been required. Liability insurers have reduced the  \npremium rates on employers who use certified operators. Some states and  cities also currently require crane \noperators to be certified. It is  likely that crane services in construction work would be divided into  two \nseparate worlds without a Federal regulatory requirement: One with  certified operators, perhaps slightly \nmore expensive but safer, and one  where operators are not certified but employers still have a  requirement \nto adequately train them. As it is difficult to predict  what the relative size of the market would be, it is not \npossible to  predict or estimate what the effect would be  in terms of future crane  safety. The Agency did \nhave substantial evidence in the record that  operator certification, although costly, sharply reduces crane  \naccidents, and did not adopt this alternative of dropping the operator  certification requirement.     Several \ncommenters in the rulemaking recommended that riggers,  crane inspectors, and signal persons also be \ncertified. The final  standard requires riggers who perform tasks such as assembly/ disassembly be qualified, \nas defined in the construction standards'  definitions. The annualized cost of certifying a crane operator is  \nabout $400 (spread over 5 years, 7 percent discount rate). The Agency  estimates that certifying a rigger would \ncost much less, about $100 per  year; a signal person, on average, $50 per year; and inspectors as much  as \na crane operator. The Agency estimates that there needs to be, at  most, on average, one certified rigger per \ncrane; one signal person for  every 3 cranes; and about 1,000 certified inspectors to conduct annual  \ninspections of all the estimated 123,000 construction cranes. The  Agency estimates that certification will \nannually cost about $100 for a  rigger, $50 for a signal person, and $400 for an inspector (as much as  a for a \ncrane operator). The Agency estimates the total annual cost of  certifying will be $14.5 million ($12.3 million \nfor riggers, $2 million  for signal persons, and $0.4 million  for inspectors). The cost of crane  inspection is \nlikely to increase since many employers will no longer be  able to have an employee perform an inspection, \nbut the Agency is not  estimating that increased cost.     Riggers are injured and killed more frequently than \nworkers in any  other occupation during construction crane activities. They are injured  when cranes tip over \nor booms fall, by falling loads, by electrical  shock from power line contact, and through falls. The Negotiated  \nRulemaking Committee focused on the safety of the crane itself  (capacity or loading limits, for example), \ncrane movement or  operations, assembly/disassembly, and power line risk rather than risks  faced by riggers \nand signal persons who work with them. The Agency  concludes that more training and certification for riggers \ncould  provide greater safety for them, but information in IMIS did not permit  a separate analysis of the role \nof riggers in crane safety. No  commenter who advocated certification for riggers provided more than a  \nqualitative assertion that increased crane safety would result. There  was similarly no information in the \nrecord that inspection failures had  resulted in accidents, save for one accident in New York City that  resulted \nfrom an inadequate repair to a tower crane part.

Builder means the builder/constructor of equipment.     Center of \ngravity: The center of g ravity of any object is the point  in the object around which its weight is evenly \ndistributed. If you  could put a support under that point, you could balance the object on  the support.     \nCertified welder means a welder who meets nationally recognized  certification requirements applicable to \nthe task being performed.     Climbing means the process in which a tower crane is raised to a  new working \nheight, either by adding additional tower sections to the  top of the crane (top climbing), or by a system  in \nwhich the entire  crane is raised inside the structure (inside climbing).     Come-a-long means a mechanical \ndevice typically consisting of a  chain or cable attached at each end that is used to facilitate movement  of \nmaterials through leverage.     Competent person means one who is capable of identifying existing  and \npredictable hazards in the surroundings or working conditions which  are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous \nto employees, and who has  authorization to take prompt corrective measures to eliminate them.      \nControlled load lowering means lowering a load by means of a  mechanical hoist drum device that allows a \nhoisted load to be lowered  with maximum control using the gear train or hydraulic components of  the hoist \nmechanism. Controlled load lowering requires the use of the  hoist drive motor, rather than the load hoist \nbrake, to lower the load.      Controlling entity mean s an employer that is a prime contractor,  general \ncontractor, construction manager or any other legal entity  which has the overall responsibility for the \nconstruction of the  project--its planning, quality and completion.     Counterweight means a weight used \nto supplement the weight of  equipment in providing stability for lifting loads by counterbalancing  those \nloads.     Crane/derrick includes all equipment covered by this subpart.      Crawler crane means \nequipment that has a type of base mounting  which incorporates a continuous belt of sprocket driven track.     \nCrossover points means locations on a wire rope which is spooled on  a drum where one layer of rope climbs \nup on and crosses over the  previous layer. This takes place at each flange of the drum as the rope  is spooled \nonto the drum, reaches the flange, and begins to wrap back  in the opposite direction.      Dedicated \nchannel means a line of communication assigned by the  employer who controls the communication system \nto only one signal  person and crane/derrick or to a coordinated group of cranes/derricks/  signal person(s).     \nDedicated pile-driver is a machine that is designed to function  exclusively as a pile -driver. These machines \ntypically have the ability  to both hoist the material that will be pile-driven and to pile-drive  that material.     \nDedicated spotter (power lines): To be considered a dedicated  spotter, the requirements of Sec.  1926.1428 \n(Signal person  qualifications) must be met and his/her sole responsibility is to watch the  separation \nbetween the power line and the equipment, load line and load  (including rigging and lifting accessories), and \nensure through communication  with the operator that the applicable minimum approach distance is not \nbreached.     Directly under the load means a part or all of an employee is  directly beneath the load.      \nDismantling includes partial dismantling (such as dismantling to  shorten a boom or substitute a differe nt \ncomponent).     Drum rotation indicator means a device on a crane or hoist which  indicates in which \ndirection and at what relative speed a particular  hoist drum is turning.     Electrical contact occurs when a \nperson, object, or equipment makes  contact or comes in close proximity with an energized conductor or  \nequipment that allows the passage of current.     Employer-made equipment means floating cranes/derricks \ndesigned and  built by an employer for the employer's own use.     Encroachment is where any part of the \ncrane, load line or load  (including rigging and lifting accessories) breaches a minimum  clearance distance",

OSHA received                                            \ncomments on the issue of                                            lowering and fully extending                                            \nthe boom before the crane can                                            be used. However, OSHA                                           \nconcludes that the comments                                            were based on a general                                            \nmisunderstanding of the                                            requirements. Section                                            \n1926.1413(a) explicitly says                                            that booming down is not                                            \nrequired for shift (and                                            therefore monthly)                                            \ninspections.                                          Similarly, OSHA stated in the                                            \nproposed preamble (73 FR                                            59770, Oct. 9, 2008) that it                                            \ndoes not believe inspection of                                            any of those items would                                            \nrequire removal of non -hinged                                           inspection plates. In the                                            \ndiscussion of proposed Sec .                                           1926.1412, OSHA requested                                           \npublic comment on this point.                                            OSHA finalized Sec.                                            \n1926.1412 as proposed because                                            comments did not \nconfirm that                                            non-hinged plates needed to be                                            \nremoved to meet the                                            requirements of a shift                                            \ninspection. The Panel recommends that OSHA consider  Previous subpart N, at former   the costs of meeting \nthe requirements    Sec.   1926.550(a)(2),   for original load charts and full        required load charts; \nthis is   manuals, and solicit comments on such    not a new cost. Subpart N did   costs.                                   \nnot require manuals. OSHA                                            concludes that most crane                                            \nowners and operators have and                                           maintain crane manuals, \nwhich                                           contain the load charts and",

However, the Committee determined that, in most instances, the wording  of the \nprovisions in these ASME standards needed revision to improve  the enforceability, clarity, and ease of use.     \nFor some issues, the ASME standards do not address issues covered  by this final rule, or the Committee \ndetermined that a d ifferent  approach was necessary. For example, in the provisions on inspections  (Sec. \nSec.  1926.1412 and 1926.1413), the Committee concluded that  shift, monthly, and annual inspection \nintervals are most appropriate,  in contrast to the ASME approach, wh ich uses \"frequent\" and  \"periodic\" \nintervals. In the provisions addressing assembly/ disassembly (Sec. Sec.  1926.1403 through 1926.1406) and \nthe  encroachment-prevention provisions for power lines (Sec. Sec.   1926.1407 through 1926.1411), the \nCommittee adopted approaches with no  comparable counterparts in the ASME standards.      In some \ninstances, the Committee determined that it was appropriate  to incorporate ASME standards by reference, \nin whole or in part. For  example, in Sec.  1926.1433 (Design, construction and testing), the  rule \nincorporates by reference ANSI B30.5-1968, safety code for  \"Crawler, Locomotive, and Truck Cranes,\" PCSA",

Equipment means equipment covered \nby this subpart.      Equipment criteria means instructions, recommendations, limitations  and \nspecifications.     Fall protection equipment means guardrail systems, safety net  systems, personal fall \narrest systems, positioning device systems or  fall restraint systems.     Fall restraint system means a fall \nprotection system that prevents  the user from falling any distance. The system is comprised of either a  body \nbelt or body harness, along with an anchorage, connectors and  other necessary equipment. The other \ncomponents typically include a  lanyard, and may also include a lifeline and other devices.      Fall zone \nmeans the area (including but not limited to the area  directly beneath the load) in which it is reasonably \nforeseeable that  partially or completely suspen ded materials could fall in the event of  an accident.      \nFlange points are points of contact between rope and drum flange  where the rope changes layers.      \nFloating cranes/derricks means equipment designed by the  manufacturer (or employer) for marine use by \npermanent attachment to a  barge, pontoons, vessel or other means of flotation.      For example means \n\"one example, although there are others.\"     Free fall (of the load line) means that only the brake is used to  \nregulate the descent of the load line (the drive mechanism is not used  to drive the load down faster or retard \nits lowering).     Free surface effect is the uncontrolled transverse movement of  liquids in compartments \nwhich reduce a vessel's transverse stability.     Hoist means a mechanical device for lifting and lowering loads \nby  winding a line onto or off a drum.     Hoisting is the act of raising, lowering or otherwise moving a load  \nin the air with equipment covered by this standard. As used in this  standard, \"hoisting\" can be done by means \nother than wire rope/hoist  drum equipment.     Include/including means \"including, but not limited to.\"      \nInsulating link/device means an insulating device listed, labeled,  or accepted by a Nationally Recognized \nTesting Laboratory in accordance  with 29 CFR 1910.7.     Jib stop (also referred to as a jib backstop), is the \nsame type of  device as a boom stop but is for a fixed or luffing jib.     Land crane/derrick is equipment not \noriginally designed by the  manufacturer for marine use by permanent attachment to barges,  pontoons, \nvessels, or other means of floatation.     List means the angle of inclination about the longitudinal axis of  a \nbarge, pontoons, vessel or other means of floatation.      Load refers to the object(s) being hoisted and/or \nthe weight of the  object(s); both uses refer to the object(s) and the load-attaching  equipment, such as, the \nload block, ropes, slings, shackles, and any  other ancillary attachment.     Load moment (or rated capacity) \nindicator means a system which aids  the equipment operator by sensing (directly or indirectly) the  \noverturning moment on the equipment, i.e., load multiplied by radius.  It compares this lifting condition to \nthe equipment's rated capacity,  and indicates to the operator the percentage of capacity at which the  \nequipment is working. Lights, bells, or buzzers may be incorporated as  a warning of an approaching overload \ncondition.     Load moment (or rated capacity) limiter means a system which aids  the equipment operator \nby sensing (directly or indirectly) the  overturning moment on the equipment, i.e., load multiplied by radius.  \nIt compares this lifting condition to the equipment's rated capacity,  and when the rated capacity is reached, \nit shuts off power to those  equipment functions which can increase the severity of loading on the  \nequipment, e.g., hoisting, telescoping out, or luffing out. Typically,  those functions which decreas e the \nseverity of loading on the equipment  remain operational, e.g., lowering, telescoping in, or luffing in.      \nLocomotive crane means a crane mounted on a base or car equipped  for travel on a railroad track.      \nLuffing jib limiting device is similar to a boom hoist limiting  device, except that it limits the movement of the \nluffing jib.

Other \nsafety devices and  operational aids must meet the requirements of Sec.  1926.1415 and  Sec.  1926.1416.      \n(ii) Nothing interferes with the equipment or the personnel  platform in the course of the trial lift.      (iii) \nThe lift will not exceed 50 percent of the equipment's rated  capacity at any time during the lift.     (iv) The \nload radius to be used during the lift has been accurately  determined.     (4) Immediately after the trial lift, \nthe competent person must:     (i) Conduct a visual inspection of the equipment, base support or  ground, \nand personnel platform, to determine whether the trial lift has  exposed any defect or problem or produced \nany adverse effect.     (ii) Confirm that, upon the completion of the trial lift process,  the test weight has \nbeen removed.     (5) Immediately prior to each lift:     (i) The platform must be hoisted a few inches with \nthe personnel  and materials/tools on board and inspected by a competent person to  ensure that it is secure \nand properly balanced.     (ii) The following conditions must be determined by a competent  person to exist \nbefore the lift of personnel proceeds:     (A) Hoist ropes must be free of deficiencies in accordance with  Sec.  \n1926.1413(a).     (B) Multiple part lines must not be twisted around each other.      (C) The primary \nattachment must be centered over the platform.     (D) If the load rope is slack, the hoisting system must be  \ninspected to ensure that all ropes are properly seated on drums and in  sheaves.     (6) Any condition found \nduring the trial lift and subsequent  inspection(s) that fails to me et a requirement of this standard or  \notherwise creates a safety hazard must be corrected before hoisting  personnel. (See Sec.  1926.1417 for tag -\nout and related requirements.)      (i) [Reserved.]     (j) Proof testing.      (1) At each jobsite, prior to \nhoisting employees on the personnel  platform, and after any repair or modification, the platform and  \nrigging must be proof tested to 125 percent of the platform's rated  capacity. The proof test may be done \nconcurrently with the trial lift.     (2) The platform must be lowered by controlled load lowering,  braked, \nand held in a suspended position for a minimum of five minutes  with the test load evenly distributed on the \nplatform.     (3) After proof testing, a competent person must inspect the  platform and rigging to \ndetermine if the test has been passed. If any  deficiencies are found that pose a safety hazard, the platform \nand  rigging must not be used to hoist personnel unless the deficiencies are  corrected, the test is repeated, \nand a competent person determines that  the test has been passed. (See Sec.  1926.1417 for tag -out and \nrelated  requirements.)     (4) Personnel hoisting must not be conducted until the compet ent  person \ndetermines that the platform and rigging have successfully  passed the proof test.",

(See Non -mandatory Appendix B of this  \nsubpart for an example.)     (7) Stability upon pin removal. The boom sections, boom suspension  systems \n(such as gantry A-frames and jib struts), and components must  be rigged or supported to maintain stability \nupon the removal of the  pins.     (8) Snagging. Suspension ropes and pendants must not be allowed to  \ncatch on the boom or jib connection pins or cotter pins (including  keepers and locking pins).     (9) Struck \nby counterweights. The potential for unintended movement  from inadequately supported counterweights \nand from hoisting  counterweights.     (10) Boom hoist brake failure. Each time reliance is to be placed  on \nthe boom hoist brake to prevent boom movement during assembly/  disassembly, the brake must be tested \nprior to such reliance to  determine if it is sufficient to prevent boom movement. If it is not  sufficient, a \nboom hoist pawl, other locking device/back-up braking  device, or another method of preventing dangerous \nmovement of the boom  (such as blocking or using an assist crane) from a boom hoist brake  failure must be \nused.

The effect of wind \nspeed and weather  on the equipment.      (i) [Reserved.]      (j) Cantilevered boom sections. \nManufacturer limitations on the  maximum amount of boom supported only by cantilevering must not be  \nexceeded. Where these are unavailable, a registered professional  engineer familiar with the type of \nequipment involved must determine in  writing this limitation, which must not be exceeded.     (k) Weight \nof components. The weight of each of the components must  be readily available.      (l) [Reserved.]      \n(m) Components and configuration.      (1) The selection of components, and configuration of the  \nequipment, that affect the capacity or safe operation of the equipment  must be in accordance with:     (i) \nManufacturer instructions, prohibitions, limitations, and  specifications. Where these are unavailable, a \nregistered professional  engineer familiar with the type of equipment involved must approve, in  writing, the \nselection and configuration of components; or     (ii) Approved modifications that meet the requirements of \nSec.   1926.1434 (Equipment modifications).      (2) Post -assembly inspection. Upon completion of \nassembly, the  equipment must be inspected to ensure compliance with paragraph (m)(1)  of this section \n(see Sec.  1926.1412(c) for post -assembly inspection  requirements).     (n) [Reserved.]     (o) Shipping \npins. Reusable shipping pins, straps, links, and  similar equipment must be removed. Once they are removed \nthey must  either be stowed or otherwise stored so that they do not present a  falling object hazard.     (p) \nPile driving. Equipment used for pile driving must not have a  jib attached during pile driving operations.      \n(q) Outriggers and Stabilizers. When the load to be handled and the  operating radius require the use of \noutriggers or stabi lizers, or at  any time when outriggers or stabilizers are used, all of the following  \nrequirements must be met (except as otherwise indicated):     (1) The outriggers or stabilizers must be either \nfully extended or,  if manufacturer procedures permit, deployed as specified in the load  chart.     (2) The \noutriggers must be set to remove the equipment weight from  the wheels, except for locomotive cranes (see \nparagraph (q)(6) of this  section for use of outriggers on locomotive cranes). This provision  does not apply \nto stabilizers.     (3) When outrigger floats are used, they must be attached to the  outriggers. When \nstabilizer floats are used, they must be attached to  the stabilizers.     (4) Each outrigger or stabilizer must \nbe visible to the operator or  to a signal person during extension and setting.",

Occupational safety and health standards  developed by State-Plan \nStates must be at least as effective in  providing safe and healthful employment and places of employment as \nthe  Federal standards. Subject to these requirements, State -Plan States are  free to develop and enforce \nunder State law their own requirements for  occupational safety and health standards.      OSHA has \nauthority under E.O. 13132 to promulgate the final rule in  29 CFR part 1926 because the employee exposures \nrelated to cranes and  derricks used in construction addressed by the requirements of the  final standard are \nnational in scope. The Agency concludes that the  requirements in this final rule will provide employers in \nevery State  with critical information to use when protecting their employees from  the hazards presented \nwhen working with cranes and derricks.     A number of commenters were concerned with the preemptive \neffect of  the final rule in jurisdictions not covered by an approved State plan.  Representatives of New York \nCity urged OSHA to make clear that the new  standard will not preempt the City's ordinances governing the \nerection,  dismantling, and operation of cranes, including crane operator  licensing requirements, that \nprotect the public in general. (ID-0342; - 0404.1.) \\142\\ The Allied Building Metal Industries Association, on the  \nother hand, stated that preemption of local crane laws is not only  preferable, but is mandated by the OSH \nAct. (ID -0344.) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\142\\ The City of Chicago \nDepartment of Buildings submitted a  late comment expressing the same concerns as those of New York City.  \n(ID-0348.1.) The concerns expressed by Chicago are mainly the same  as those of New York, and are addressed \nin the discussion of the New  York laws. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      The \nOSH Act does not contain an express preemption provision. \\143\\  However, in accordance with ordinary \nconflict preemption principles,  preemption may be implied where the State law conflicts with Federal  law \nor is an impediment to full accomplishment of the Federal purpose.  Gade v. National Solid Wastes \nManagement Ass'n, 505 U.S. 88, 100  (1992). The determination whether, under Gade, a State or local law is  \nimpliedly preempted by a Federal occupational safety or health standard  involves a detailed examination of \nthe specific provisions and purposes  of the law. The Secretary previously e xamined New York City's crane  \nordinances and concluded that they were not preempted by the prior  crane standard. OSHA has placed the \nSecretary's amicus brief in Steel  Institute of New York v. The City of New York, No. 09 -CV-6539 (CM)  (JCF) \non the recor d. (ID-0419.1.) This brief presents the agency's  interpretation of the preemptive effect of the \nprior rule on New York  City's crane ordinances. For the same reasons set forth in the amicus  brief--which \nare summarized below--New York City's crane ordinances are  not preempted by this final rule. ------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------      \\143\\ The proposed rule incorrectly stated that sec. 18 of \nthe  Act expressly provides OSHA with authority to preempt State  occupational safety and health standards \nto the extent that the  Agency promulgates a permanent Federal standard (73 FR 59913, Oct.  9, 2008). -----\n----------------------------------------------------------------------      In the Steel Institute case, the Secretary concluded \nthat the OSH  Act does not preempt municipal building codes like New York City's  crane ordinances, which \nare designed to protect the public and  neighboring structures from the hazards of cranes and do not conflict  \nwith OSHA standards. In Gade, a plurality read the provisions of sec.  18 of the Act to preempt supplementary \nState laws that are not part of  an approved State plan. 505 U.S. at 100-108. However, sec. 18 refers to  states, \nnot localities, and does not evince a clear intention to  preempt local building codes. The Gade decision did \nnot address local  building codes, and the plurality's rationale for concluding that State  laws may be \npreempted does not apply with equal measure to municipal  building codes. The plurality relied chiefly on the",

Many of these duties are imposed \non  manufacturers, owners, engineers, designated representatives and others  who need not be employers \nor employees. By contrast, this final rule,  like the prior crane rule, applies only to construction work as defined  \nin OSHA regulations, which relates to the performance of physical trade  labor on site and does not generally \ninclude engineers, who are the  subject of several of the City's ordinances.      Comparison of the City's \ncrane ordinances to fire safety laws --a  category of laws expressly recog nized in Gade as being \"generally  \napplicable\"--further bolsters the argument that the City's laws are  not preempted. 505 U.S. at 107. Fire safety \nlaws impose requirements  that directly and substantially regulate workplace conduct to protect  the public \nand property from fire. (ID-0419.1.) For example, both the  International Fire Code, on which many local codes \nare based, and the  New York City Fire Code, contain provisions applicable to specific  workplaces, such as \nAviation Facilities and Operations, and  Semiconductor Fabrication Facilities, and specific work operations,  \nsuch as Combustible Dust -Producing Operations and Welding and Other Hot  Work. Id. The New York and \nInternational Fire Codes also contain  requirements applicable during the construction of buildings, including  \nrequirements for daily disposal of waste and limitations on the use of  portable oxygen containers and  \ninternal-combustion-powered equipment at  the construction site. Id. Like the City's crane safety laws, these  \nwork-related fire safety laws include training, certification and  recordkeeping requirements. Id. The fact that \nNew York City's crane  ordinances similarly regulate workplace conduct is therefore fully  consistent with the \nCity ordinances being laws of general  applicability.     Although the interpretation outlined above was \ndeveloped based on  consideration of the specific provisions of New Yor k City's crane  ordinances, the \npreemption principles set forth are generally  applicable. The agency does not believe that this final rule \npreempts  any non -conflicting local or municipal building code designed to  protect the public from the \nhazards of c ranes.  E. State-Plan States      When Federal OSHA promulgates a new standard or more \nstringent  amendment to an existing standard, the 27 States and U.S. Territories  with their own OSHA -\napproved occupational safety and health plans  (\"State-Plan States\") must amend their standards to reflect \nthe new  standard or amendment, or show OSHA why such action is unnecessary,  e.g., because an existing \nState standard covering this area is \"at  least as effective\" as the new Federal standard or amendment. 29 CFR  \n1953.5(a). The State standard must be at least as effective as the  final Federal rule, must be applicable to both \nthe private and public  (State and local government employees) sectors, and must be completed  within six \nmonths of the promulgation date of the final Federal rule.  When OSHA promulgates a new standard or \namendment that does not impose  additional or more stringent requirements than an existing standard,  \nState-Plan States are not required to amend their standards, although  the Agency may encourage them to do \nso. The 27 States and U.S.  Territories with OSHA-approved occupational safety and health plans  are: Alaska, \nArizona, California, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky,  Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, \nNorth Carolina,  Oregon, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont,  Virginia, Washington, and \nWyoming; Connecticut, Illinois, New Jersey,  New York, and the Virgin Islands have OSHA-approved State Plans \nthat  apply to State and local government employees only.      This final rule results in more stringent \nrequirements for the work  it covers. Therefore, States and Territories with approved State Plans  must adopt \ncomparable amendments to their standards within six months  of the promulgation date of this rule unless \nthey demonstrate that such  amendments are not necessary because their existing standards are at  least as \neffective in protecting workers as this final rule.

(A) Lattice boom cranes manufactured after Feb 28, 1992, must be  equipped with a device that \neither automatically prevents damage and  load failure from contact between the load block, overhaul ball, \nor  similar component, and the boom tip (or fixed upper block or similar  component), or warns the operator \nin time for the op erator to prevent  two-blocking. The device must prevent such damage/failure or provide  \nadequate warning for all points where two -blocking could occur.     (B) Lattice boom cranes and derricks \nmanufactured after November 8,  2011 must be equipped with a device which automatically prevents damage  \nand load failure from contact between the load block, overhaul ball, or  similar component, and the boom tip \n(or fixed upper block or similar  component). The device(s) must prevent such damage/failure at all  points \nwhere two-blocking could occur.     (C) Exception. The requirements in paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)(A) and (B)  of \nthis section do not apply to such lattice boom equipment when used  for dragline, clamshell (grapple), magnet, \ndrop ball, container  handling, concrete bucket, marine operations that do not involve  hoisting personnel, \nand pile driving work.     (D) Temporary alternative measures. Clearly mark the cable (so that  it can easily \nbe seen by the operator) at a point that will give the  operator sufficient time to stop the hoist to prevent two-\nblocking, or  use a spotter.     (iii) Articulating cranes manufactured after December 31, 1999,  that are \nequipped with a load hoist must be equipped with a device that  automatically prevents damage from contact \nbetween the load block,  overhaul ball, or similar component, and the boom tip (or fixed upper  block or \nsimilar component). The device must prevent such damage at all  points where two-blocking could occur. \nTemporary alternative measures:  When two-blocking could only occur with movement of the load hoist,  \nclearly mark the cable (so that it can easily be seen by the operator)  at a point that will give the operator \nsufficient time to stop the  hoist to prevent two-blocking, or use a spotter. When two-blocking  could occur \nwithout movement of the load hoist, clearly mark the cable  (so that it can easily be seen by the operator) at \na point that will  give the operator sufficient time to stop the hoist to prevent two- blocking, and use a spotter \nwhen extending the boom.

Operational aids \nlisted in this paragraph that are not working properly  must be repaired no later than 30 calendar days after \nthe deficiency  occurs. Exception: If the employer documents that it has ordered the  necessary parts within \n7 calendar days of the occurrence of the  deficiency, and the part is not received in time to complete the repair  \nin 30 c alendar days, the repair must be completed within 7 calendar  days of receipt of the parts. See Sec.  \n1926.1417(j) for additional  requirements.     (1) Boom angle or radius indicator. The equipment must have \na boom  angle or radius indicator readable from the operator's station.  Temporary alternative measures: \nRadii or boom angle must be determined  by measuring the radii or boom angle with a mea suring device.     \n(2) Jib angle indicator if the equipment has a luffing jib.  Temporary alternative measures: Radii or jib angle \nmust be determined  by ascertaining the main boom angle and then measuring the radii or jib  angle with a \nmeasuring device.

The two largest sources of costs in the rule \nare operator  certification and rules covering operations close to power lines. The  experience of Ontario and \nCalifornia shows that operator certification  can make a major difference to crane fatalities. Additional work \ndone  for this final rule shows that construction crane fatalities also occur  in general industry sectors where \nconstruction work is performed. As a  result, and as more fully discussed in the scope and operator  \ncertification sections of this preamble, OSHA continues to believe that  operator certification for cranes doing \nconstruction work is necessary  to prevent crane -related deaths and injury. OSHA also believes that the  \npower line rules developed through the expertise of C -DAC remain  necessary to address the largest single \nsource of crane-related  construction fatalities--fatalities due to power line contact. 4. A Description of and an \nEstimate of the Number of Small Entities to  Which the Rule Will Apply     OSHA completed an analysis of \nthe economic impacts associated with  this final rule, including an analysis of the type and number of small  \nentities to which the rule would apply, as described above. To  determine the number of small entities \npotentially affected by this  rulemaking, OSHA used the definitions of small entities developed by  the Small \nBusiness Administration (SBA) for each industry.     For the construction industry generally, SBA defines small  \nbusinesses using revenue -based criteria. For most of the affected  construction industries, including those \nindustries that are mostly  comprised of general contractors, firms with annual revenues of less  than $31 \nmillion are classified as small businesses. For specialty  contractors, such as structural -steel erection \ncontractors, firms with  annual revenues of less than $13 million are  considered to be small  businesses. \nBased on the definitions of small entities developed by SBA  for each industry, the final rule is estimated to \npotentially affect a  total of 204,000 small entities, as shown in Tables B-13 and B-14.  Included in this number \nare an estimated 187,000 entities with fewer  than 20 employees (Table B -15). 5. A Description of the \nProjected Reporting, Recordkeeping and Other  Compliance Requirements of the Rule, Including an Estimate \nof the  Classes of Small Entities Which Will Be Subject to the Requirement and  the Type of Professional Skills \nNecessary for Preparation of the Report  or Record     The final rule addresses the work practices used, as \nwell as other  requirements, for performing construction work involving cranes/  derricks. Employers are \nrequired to keep specified records associated  with inspections and operator certification/qualification.      \nOther compliance requirements in th e standard include the assembly  and disassembly requirements, \nencroachment-prevention precautions when  working near power lines, and ground condition and power line  \nassessments.     The preamble to the standard provides a comprehensive description  of the standard's \nrequirements. The final economic analysis located in  the preamble provides a description of the types of \nbusiness entities  subject to these requirements, and the types of professional skills  necessary to comply \nwith the requirements.  Regulatory Alternatives      The Agency considered alternatives to the many \nprovisions in the  proposed standard, and these are presented and discussed in the Final  Regulatory \nFlexibility Analysis below, as well as throughout the  Preamble. Crane operator certification was one of the \nmain issues in  the rulemaking, and the Agency concludes that provisions for  certification offer the most \nprominent way to consider both a more  stringent standard (requiring certification of inspectors, riggers, and",
