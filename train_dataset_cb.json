The Agency evaluated reports  from the effect of crane regulations in California \nas well as the  Canadian province of Ontario. The Agency concluded that results from  these two regulatory \nefforts are consistent with OSHA's conclusion that  the final standard reduces risk of construction crane \naccidents and  injures; however, the Agency determined that review of IMIS records  would provide a better \nmethod to quantify benefits.     This same analysis also showed that there is a serious risk of  fatalities in \nGeneral Industry construction work. Table 7 shows the  fatalities in construction related work in the General \nIndustry sectors  that have been added to the economic analysis.

Analyzing IMIS Crane Fatality Reports     OSHA typically measures \nthe risk reduction, or benefit, of its  safety standards by examining accid ent reports. Accidents that occur  \nbecause of a failure to comply with an existing standard are not  counted as a benefit, or risk reduction, that \nis attributed to the  effect of the new standard.

    "4869e18b-5add-4dc4-b1a9-540774909728": "page_label: 36\nfile_name: OSHA-Final Rule-Cleaned.pdf\nfile_path: C:\\Users\\bs44876\\Desktop\\Project\\CII-Crane\\FineEmb\\dataset\\data\\OSHA-Final Rule-Cleaned.pdf\nfile_type: application/pdf\nfile_size: 3496317\ncreation_date: 2025-01-07\nlast_modified_date: 2025-01-07\n\nwork would mean that the same machinery might be excluded  for some work but covered when it is used at \ndifferent worksites.  However, the general lifting work done at those o ther worksites would  be subject to \nthis standard if done by other types of lifting  equipment, and the same standards should apply as apply to \nthat  equipment. OSHA concludes that excluding digger derricks only for the  work for which they are \nprimarily designed and used is a reasonable  approach. It accommodates the considerations that led C-DAC to \npropose  a partial exclusion while treating digger derricks used for other  construction work the same as \nother, similar equipment used for such  work.     OSHA also declines to extend the exclusion broadly to \ninstallation  of all poles for outdoor lighting along roadways, as one commenter  suggested. OSHA notes that \nsome poles that carry electric and  telecommunication lines also have street lights installed on  them, and  \nuse of digger derricks to install such lights would qualify for the  exclusion to the extent that the employer \ncomplies with either  Sec. Sec.  1910.268 or 1910.269. It is unclear whether, and to what  extent, digger \nderricks are used to install other types of poles used  for lighting alone which do not carry electric power lines \nor  telecommunication lines. Many such poles are installed on aboveground  concrete bases rather than set \nin holes in the ground, and it is  unclear whether and to what extent digger derricks are used to install  them. \nIn this regard, OSHA notes that the commenter asking for the  exclusion to be extended to light poles \nrepresents equipment manufacturers,  and no company that installs lighting poles suggested such an \nexclusion.  To the extent that some light pole installation would not be covered by  either Sec. Sec.  \n1910.268 or 1910.269, extending the exclusion to such work  would leave the excluded work without coverage \nby an appropriate general  industry standard and leave workers without the protection they receive  when \nperforming electric utility or telecommunication work.      OSHA disagrees with the comment that digger \nderricks should not be  excluded at all because of the danger of power line contact. As  discussed above, the \ndigger derrick exclusion is limited to situations  in which certain general industry standards apply, and those \ngeneral  industry standards, both Sec. Sec.  1910.268 and 1910.269, contain  requirements for protecting \nagainst power line contact.      Proposed paragraph (c)(5) specifically excludes machinery  originally \ndesigned as vehicle mounted aerial lif ts and self -propelled  elevating work platforms. The language of this \nprovision reflects C- DAC's intent to differentiate between equipment with an attachment such  as a personnel \nplatform pinned to the boom, which is within the scope  of the proposed rule , and machinery originally \ndesigned to be  configured only as an aerial lift, which is excluded. Another standard,  Sec.  1926.453, \naddresses aerial lifts. The only comments to address  this exclusion supported retaining it. (ID-0129.1; -0312.1.)  \nAccordingly, paragraph (c)(5) is promulgated as proposed.      Proposed paragraph (c)(6) excluded \ntelescopic/hydraulic gantry  systems. C-DAC excluded this machinery because it presents hazards that  differ \nin many respects from those presented by the equipment cov ered  by this standard. As a result, many \nprovisions of this standard would  not be workable or needed for this equipment, and hazards unique to  this \ntype of machinery would not be addressed. In the proposed rule,  OSHA noted that the Specialized Carriers & \nRigging Foundation recently  issued a voluntary consensus standard for telescopic/hydraulic gantry  systems. \n(73 FR 59730, Oct. 9, 2008; ID -0027.) As no comments on this  exclusion were received, paragraph (c)(6) is \npromulgated as proposed.     Under proposed paragraph (c)(7), stacker cranes were excluded. C- DAC noted \nthat these cranes are rarely used in construction, and their  configuration is too unlike other equipment \ncovered by the proposed  standard to warrant inclusion. No comments on this exclusion were  received, and \nparagraph (c)(7) is promulgated as proposed.",

The  \nauthors examined OSHA IMIS data to identify the number of fatal  accidents involving cranes, and determined \ntheir causes. For the years  in question, they found 479 accidents involving 502 fatalities. In the  worst year, \n1990, 70 deaths occurred. The authors noted some  limitations in the data they examined: Data for California, \nMichigan,  and Washington State were not available for 1984 -1989; the proportion  of fatal accidents \ninvestigated by OSHA and states having OSHA -approved  State plans is unknown; and some of the \ninvestigation reports were not  sufficiently detailed to allow the authors to determine the cause of  the \naccident or the type of crane involved.

Sec.  1926.1407 - 1926.1411, which deal with power-line safety. \nThese sections contain  requirements to prevent equipment from contacting energized power  lines. The \nfinal standard delineates systematic, reliable procedures  and methods that employers must use to prevent a \nsafe clearance  distance from being breached. If maintaining the safe clearance  distance is infeasible, \nadditional protections are required, including  grounding the equipment, covering the line with an insulating \nsleeve,  and using insulating links and nonconductive tag lines.

Two trade \nassociations  agreed that Sec.  1926.1412(f) should state that the corrective action  required for \nmalfunctioning operational aids is that specified in Sec.   1926.1416. (ID-0205.1; -0213.1.) OSHA also notes \nthat Sec.   1926.1435(e) specifies the temporary alternative measures that must be  implemented when \noperational aids on tower cranes malfunction, and  Sec.  1926.1412(f)(5) applies to tower cranes as well as \nequipment  covered by Sec.  1926.1416. Paragraph  (f)(5) of the final rule is  modified accordingly. -----------\n----------------------------------------------------------------      \\73\\ Paragraph (f)(2)(v), as proposed and in the final \nrule,  distinguishes between deficiencies that result in \"significant  inaccuracies\" in the operation of any of \nthe safety devices or  operational aides, and those that do not. The phrase \"significant  inaccuracies\" reflects \nthe fact that such devices normally operate  within a tolerance range. Corrective actions are not required if \nthe  inaccuracy is so small as to be irrelevant regarding the safe  operation of the equipment. In contrast, \nsignificant inaccuracies in  these devices could mislead the operator and contribu te to actions  that could \nresult in the equipment being inadvertently used in an  unsafe manner. -------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------      Moreover, OSHA is adding text to paragraph (f)(1) of this section  to emphasize \nthat paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section do not  apply to annual inspections.      Paragraph (f)(7), \nDocumentation of annual/comprehensive inspection,  requires the employer that conducts the inspection to \ncomplete and  maintain, for a minimum of  twelve months, documentation that contains  \"[t]he items \nchecked and the results of the inspection,\" and \"[t]he  name and signature of the person who conducted the \ninspection and the  date of the inspection.\" Section 1926.1413(c)(4), which pertains to  the \nannual/comprehensive wire rope inspection, contains a similar  documentation requirement. In the proposed \nrule, the 12-month retention  requirement was located in paragraph (f)(7)(iii). OSHA has incorporated  that \nrequirement into the introductory senten ce to clarify that it is  the employer who conducts the inspection \nwho must retain the documents  for 12 months. OSHA has also clarified that the date of the inspection,  not \nthe date on which the document was signed, must be entered on the  document.     During the SBREFA \nprocess, several Small Entity Representatives  objected to the requirement for documentation of monthly and \nannual  inspections, stating that such documentation would be unduly burdensome  and would not, in their \nopinions, add to worker safety. The Panel  recommended that OSHA solicit public comment on the extent of  \ninspection documentation the rule should require. OSHA requested  comment on this issue.      A local \ngovernment supported annual/comprehensive inspection  documentation. (ID-0156.) It also commented that \ndaily logs should be  maintained and submitted to the crane owner to capture when maintenance  has been \nperformed on the equipment, and maint ained by the equipment  owner for the life of the crane. This \ncommenter did not, however,  explain how such a retention requirement would produce safety benefits,  \nand OSHA declines to adopt it.      The Committee determined that the documentation of the an nual  \ninspection, signed by the person who conducted the inspection and  retained for 12 months, would have \nseveral effects. First, it would  increase the likelihood that more employers would implement systems for  \nconducting and responding to inspections. Second, the failure to do so  would be more readily apparent if a \nrecord was not made, and the  signature of the person who conducted the inspection would be an  \ninducement to that person to ensure that the inspection was done  correctly.     The Agency notes that the \nthree month retention period reflects the  Committee's decision to have a retention period that is consistent \nwith  Department of Transportation truck inspection documentation  requirements.     The \ndocumentation of these inspections serves as references that  inspectors can use to monitor the condition of",

C-DAC determined that non -lattice booms generally present more  hazards to \nworkers who must walk them to reach other work areas,  devices, and equipment attached to it than lattice \nbooms. Non -lattice  booms are typically of the extensible type. As a result, as members  noted, the \nwalking/working surfaces on these types of booms are often  oily (from the hydraulic mechanisms). Also, since \nthe boom sections  extend and retract, it is typically infeasible to provide boom walkways  and other safety \nfeatures. Because they tend to be slippery from oil,  the Committee concluded that they are espec ially \nhazardous to move  across even when horizontal. Therefore, where an employee is required  to move point \nto point on a non -lattice boom, the Agency decided to  remain consistent with the requirements in 29 CFR \npart 1926 subpart M  to require fall protection at heights at or above 6 feet and the final  rule requires fall \nprotection when the fall distance is greater than 6  feet.     Paragraph (e)(1)(ii) applies the same fall \nprotection requirements  to point to point movement on lattice booms that are not in a  horizontal position. \nThe Committee found that in non-A/D work, an  employee may, for example, need to move point-to-point on \na lattice  boom to inspect a part that is suspected to need repair, or to make a  repair (such as replacing a \nbroken or mi ssing cotter pin). In many of  these situations, the boom will not be horizontal, since space  \nlimitations often make it difficult to lower the boom to do this work.      The Committee determined that it \nis both necessary and feasible for  fall protection to be used in such instances. Typically, the fall  protection \nthat would be used would consist of a double-lanyard or  similar personal fall arrest system. Since the boom \nin these instances  would be elevated, there would usually be a point on the boom abov e the  level of the \nemployee's feet to which the lanyard could be attached.     In contrast, it is uncommon for an employee to \nneed to move point- to-point on a horizontal lattice boom for non-A/D work. If work does  need to be done, \nsuch as making an insp ection or repair as discussed  above, the employee would usually get access to their \nwork station with  a ladder. In those instances when the employee must traverse the boom  itself, the \nCommittee concluded that it would be inappropriate to  require fall protection for the reasons discussed \nbelow.     The key difficulty in providing fall protection in such instances  stems from the lack of a tie -off \npoint above the level of the   employee's feet. The Committee discussed that most lattice booms when  \nhorizontal would be less than 15 feet above the next lower level. At  heights below 15 feet, a personal fall \narrest system tied off at the  level of the employee's feet, with a lanyard long enough to afford the  employee \nthe range of movement necessary for this work, might not  prevent the employee from falling to the next \nlower level.     In construction work the problem of providing personal fall  protection in this height range, \nwhen there is no higher tie -off point,  is usually solved in one of three ways (apart from the use of ladders,  \nscaffolds, aerial lifts, and similar devices). One way is to use a  restraint system, which is anchored at a point \nthat prevents the  employee from moving past an edge. The Committee discussed that this  type of system \ncould not be used while on a boom because the boom is  too narrow. Another method is to set up a personal \nfall arrest system  that would arrest the employee's fall before hitting the n ext lower  level by using \nstanchions to support an elevated, horizontal life-line.  However, such stanchions must be securely fastened \nand whatever they  are fastened to must be able to withstand considerable forces in an  arrested fall. On a \ncrane's lattice boom, the stanchions would have to  be attached either to the chords or the lacings.     The \nchords and lacings are engineered to be as light as possible,  and an engineering analysis would be needed in \neach case to determine  if the attachment point was sufficiently strong to withstand those  forces.",

(ID-0151.1.) The  commenter also questioned whether sufficient \nanalysis had been done to  show that the proposed requirements would improve the safety of crane  \noperations. This commenter believed that the curr ent requirement (Sec.   1926.20(b)(4)) for equipment \noperators to be qualified by training or  experience was sufficient. A witness from a similar trade association  \nexpressed a similar view, stating that training, not certification, is  the answer to safe crane operations. (ID-\n0343.)     A representative of the building industry thought the requirements  were too restrictive and \nstated that OSHA failed to show that the  limited requirements would substantially reduces the risk of \naccidents  while other alternatives would not. (ID-0232.1.) The commenter asked  that its members have the \noption to self-evaluate their operators after  they have gone through a specified training program in lieu of \nthe  third-party certification that would be required under proposed Option  (1) of this section for cranes of \nless than 35 ton capacity with a boom  length no greater than 120 feet. A witness who appeared on behalf of  \nthe commenter criticized the proposal for imposing the same  requirements on employers engaged in \nresidential construction as those  in commercial construction and said training and certification  \nrequirements should be crane and industry specific. (ID -0341.)     Another trade association similarly \nrecommended that its members be  given the ability to sel f-certify their operators. (ID -0218.1.) A small  \nbusiness representative asked OSHA to assess whether it is feasible to  allow small employers to \"self-certify\" \nthat an operator is trained  and competent to operate the equipment and perform the tasks being   \nconducted.\\108\\ (ID-0147.1.) A trade association suggested that OSHA  consider the feasibility of allowing \nsmall employers to \"self- certify\" that their operators are trained and competent to operate the  equipment \nand perform their assigned tasks. (ID -0187.1.) Another trade  association believed that mandatory self -\ncertification was a feasible  option for operators of what it characterized as \"light-duty\" cranes  used by its \nmembers. (ID-0189.1.) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\108\\ The commenter, \nhowever, also acknowledged that there are  small businesses that are in favor of third -party certification.  \n(ID-0147.1.) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      An energy association argued that \nfirms engaged in wind turbine  construction should be permitted to self -certify their crane  operators.- (ID-\n0329.1.) The commenter stated that construction of wind  turbines requires the use of the largest and most \ncomplex cranes  available, and that some of its members had found that some operators  certified by NCCCO \nwere not truly qualified to operate those cranes. It  therefore believed that firms in its industry should be able \nto self- qualify their crane operators, but objected to the need for employers  in its industry who use Option \n(2) of this section to be required to  use the services of an auditor. The commenter said it did not believe  \nthat there would be properly trained and qualified people available to  audit the wind industry. Instead of \nrequiring auditors, the commenter  suggested that OSHA add to the find rule additional, detailed criteria  \nthat an employer-sponsored program must contain to be acceptable.     OSHA rejects the suggestions of the \ncommenters who argued that  employers should have the option of determining that their operators  are \nqualified without any form of third -party verification. Based on  the rulemaking record, OSHA is persuaded \nthat the third-party  requirements in the proposed rule are an essential element in improving  crane safety. \nThe members of C -DAC, who had vast collective experience  in all aspects of crane operations, reached a \nconsensus (with two  members dissenting) \\109\\ that third-party verification was needed to  reduce the \nnumber of crane accidents and fatal ities in the construction  industry. Their consensus was supported by a \nnumber of commenters,  including some employers who have already had their operators certified  through \na third -party process and have found certification to be a  useful and cost -effective means of promoting",

(ID - 0180.1; -0205.1; -0213.1.) According to \nthese commenters, any of these  devices would prevent the boom hoist drum from spinning freely and  \nallowing the boom to free fall in the event the main boom hoist brake  (required by Sec.  1926.1435(d)(vii)(A)) \nfails.     OSHA concludes that any of the devices mentioned by these  commenters, if working properly, \nwould comply with this provision.  However, the commenters did not address the question posed in the  \nproposal as to whether there is a temporary measure that should be  required if the device is not working \nproperly. If the drum was, for  example, equipped with a ratchet and pawl locking device, the record  does \nnot show that it would be practical to install another type of  device in the event the ratchet and pawl device \nis not working  properly.     Upon further reviewing proposed paragraph (e)(5)(viii), OSHA  determines it \nwas C-DAC's intent to require a positive locking  mechanism that could be set from a control at the operator's \nstation  and to require, as a temporary alternative measure if the control is  not working, that the device be \nset manually. Moreover, OSHA concludes  that such an alternative would provide an adequate temporary  \nalternative. Such a device would be analogous to the parking brake of a  car, which can normally be actuated \nfrom the driver's seat but, in the  event that control fails, the car can be kept from moving by chocking  the \nwheels. To express this intent more clearly, OSHA  is modifying  paragraph (e)(5)(viii) accordingly.      \nParagraph (e)(6) requires the category II operational aids  discussed below and specifies the alternative \nmeasures that would have  to be followed if they are not working properly. If these operational  aids are not \nworking properly, they must be repaired no later than 30  days after the deficiency occurs. However, if the \nemployer documents  that it has ordered the necessary parts within 7 days of the occurrence  of the \ndeficiency, and the part is not r eceived in time to complete the  repair in 30 days, the repair must be \ncompleted within 7 days of  receipt of the parts. As noted above, the word \"days\" in the proposed  rule has \nbeen changed to \"calendar days\" in the final rule.     Paragraph (e)(6)(i) requires a boom angle or hook radius \nindicator  as specified in Sec. Sec.  1926.1435(e)(6)(i)(A) and (B). Under these  provisions, luffing boom \ntower cranes are required to have a boom angle  indicator readable from the operator's station. Hammerhead \ntower cranes  manufactured more than one year after the effective date of this  standard are required to \nhave a hook radius indicator readable from the  operator's station. These devices are needed because the \ninformation  they provide is necessary for the operator to determine the crane's  capacity under its load \nchart. As with the similar devices required  under Sec.  1926.14 16, the temporary alternative is to measure \nthe boom  angle or hook radius with a measuring device (Sec.   1926.1435(e)(6)(i)(C)).     Section \n1926.1435(e)(6)(ii) requires tower cranes to have a trolley  travel deceleration device that would automatically \nreduce the trolley  speed before the trolley reaches the end limit in both directions.  Section \n1926.1435(e)(6)(iii) requires tower cranes to have a boom hoist  deceleration device, which would \nautomatically reduce the boom speed  before a luffing boom reaches the minimum or maximum radius limit.  \nSection 1926.1435(e)(6)(iv) requires tower cranes to have a load hoist  deceleration device, which would \nautomatically limit the load speed  before the load hoist reaches the upper limit.",

An employer can comply with both  \nrequirements by using equipment with an insulating boom and grounding  the uninsulated portion of the \nequipment (that is, the portion below  the insulated section of the boom).     It should also be noted that, \nin the subpart V rulemaking, OSHA has  proposed to prohibit equipment (other than insulated aerial lifts,  \nwhich are not covered by this final rule) from being operated closer  than the minimum approach distances \nfrom power lines. If this  prohibition is carried into the final subpart V rule, then the  requirements in this \nfinal rule relating to work inside the distance in  Table V-1 will have no effect.     Finally, Sec.  1926.1400(g) \nincludes a new compliance alternative  for subpart V work that has been added to the final rule. Paragraph (l) \n[Reserved] Paragraph (m)     As noted above, the training requirements contained in Sec.   1926.1408(g) \nare being added to this section as well to assure that  employees engaged in activities under this section \nreceive adequate  training. Section 1926.1411 Power Line Safety--While Traveling Under Power Lines  With \nNo Load Paragraph (a)     Proposed paragraph (a) provided that this section is designed to  protect against \nelectrical hazards while equipment is traveling with no  load under power lines on a construction site. It did \nnot address the  potential hazards associated with equ ipment traveling without a load  near power lines. \nOSHA requested public comment on whether it is  necessary to expand the applicability of this section to \ninclude  equipment traveling on a construction site without a load near power  lines.     Two commenters \nfavored broadening the applicability of Sec.   1926.1411 to include equipment traveling near power lines, \nwith  \"near\" being defined as the distances listed in Table T. (ID -0205.1;  -0213.1.) One commenter \nresponded that adding an additional set of  power line clearance distances to trigger the requirements of Sec.   \n1926.1411 would be confusing. (ID -0144.1.) A four th commenter thought  that the requirements of Sec.  \n1926.1411 should extend to cover  equipment traveling \"along side of\" power lines, but did not suggest  a \ndefinition for the term \"along side of.\" (ID -0155.1.)     After considering these public comments , OSHA \nconcludes that this  section should address the hazard of equipment traveling near, as well  as under, power \nlines with no load. If equipment comes into electrical  contact with a power line while traveling without a load, \nthe same  electrocution hazard is present as when it is operating with a load.  The precautions in this section \nwill protect workers against that  hazard.     OSHA agrees with the two commenters who suggested that \nTable T of  this section contains appropriate clearances for equipment traveling  near, as well as under, power \nlines. Applying Table T to equipment  traveling near power lines will provide a uniform rule for this section  \nand will ensure adequate worker protection. Although the Table T  clearance distances are less than t hose \nrequired under Table A of Sec.   1926.1408 during crane operations, additional protection is provided  under \nthis section by the requirement in paragraph (b)(1), discussed  below, that the boom/mast and boom/mast \nsupport system be lowered  sufficiently to meet the requirements of this paragraph. With the boom/  mast \nlowered, the highest point of the equipment will generally be  below the plane of the power line, reducing \nthe risk of accidental  contact. Moreover, as also noted below, the dedicated spott er  requirement of Sec.  \n1926.1411(b)(4) will be triggered whenever the  equipment while traveling will get closer than 20 feet to a \npower line,  thereby providing additional protection against accidental contact.     Accordingly, in the final \nrule, paragraph (a) applies to  \"equipment traveling under or near a power line on a construction site  with \nno load.\" In addition, in the proposed rule, the heading of Sec.   1926.1411 read: \"Power line safety--while \ntraveling.\" In the final  rule, OSHA has added the words \"under or near power lines with no  load\" so that the \nheading more clearly describes the activity to which  the section applies.",

More often than  not, however, the utility discovered that work is being performed close  to a \npower line when it is observed by happenstance, for many  contractors simply do not call.\" (ID -0342.) \nAlthough the electric  utility industry predicted that the number of these episodes involving  construction \ncranes would double or increase exponentially, and thereby  force them to incur greater costs under the \nstandard, the Agency  disagrees. The final standard imposes significant new procedures and costs  beyond \nwhat current standards require. Generally, one expects crane users  in the affected industries to take further \nsteps to avoid working closer than  the Table A distances to power lines, rather than more.     The Agency \nincluded in its cost estimates for work closer than  Table A distances the following:      A planning meeting \n(2 hours for three individuals costing  about $132);      Time and costs for th e utility owner/operator or \nengineer  for all of their duties (6 hours or $360), i.e., planning, voltage  information, determining a minimum \nclearance distance, reviewing  procedures, and identification of an individual to implement  procedures;      \nRequest that electric utilities de-activate the automatic  re-energizing devices, which the Agency assumes will \ncost crane  employers $320, on average, to be paid to electric utilities;       Use a dedicated spotter at all \ntimes (average of 4 hours,  $64.06);      Use of an insulating link ($210); and      Provision of barricades \nand grounding of equipment ($4.04  and $8.08).  The crane user must also secure voltage information from \nthe electric  utility, but the Agency assumes that since the utility's owner/operator  or an engineer is present, \nthis information is at hand; therefore, for  work within Table A distances, there is no separate, additional cost.     \nSince line hoses or barriers are already required, and terms are  currently arranged between the crane \nemployer and the utility, there is  no new cost for line covers under the final standard. The Agency  concludes \nthat the crane employer faces, at a minimum, about $800 in  new costs under the final standard to work within \n10 feet or the Table  A distance of a power line. If the employer must also fully compensate  the electric \nutility for the utility owner's or engineer's time, the  total cost is estimated at $1,100.     The final standard \nseems to shift the duty and expense of line  covers wholly onto electric utilities, with crane contractors \nreported  as compensating electric utilities to some degree currently. (ID -0342.)  However, the limited \ncomment on this issue in the record does not  permit an estimate of any effect.     All other provisions of \nthe final standard's Sec.  1926.1410 are  already being performed in current construction crane jobs close to  \npower lines, the Agency concludes.  Assembly/Disassembly Near Power Lines      Under the proposed \nstandard, before beginning crane assembly/ disassembly, the crane operator or employer must determine if \nany parts  of the crane or equipment may get closer than 20 feet to a power line  during A/D. If so, either the \nemployer must have the line de-energized  (Option (1)); stay farther than 20 feet from the power line (Option  \n(2)); or follow the procedures in Option (3): determine the line  voltage and minimum clearance distance; \nprevent encroachment by having  a planning meeting and use either a dedicated spotter, proximity alarm,  a \n\"range control warning device,\" or an elevated warning line. The  Agency believes that by far the most \ncommon method will be to provide a  dedicated spotter during A/D. There was considerable comment in the  \nrecord that de-energizing lines was rare, difficult for regulatory  reasons, and expensive. (ID-0342.)     The \nAgency has estimated costs as if A/D operations near power  lines follow Option (3) and that crane employers \nor owners use a  spotter to ensure that cranes stay far enough away. In the PEA, the  Agency estimated that \nthis happened in 25 percent of crane jobs. There  was no comment on that estimate in the rulemaking, and \nthe Agency  concludes that A/D near power lines occurs about 200,000 times per  year.     The Agency has \nestimated A/D costs near power lines as follows:      Crane operators and employers already assess distance \nto  power lines; so the Agency takes this as a baseline and concludes there  are no new costs due to this",

Paragraph (h)(4) \nVerifying Assist Crane Loads     This paragraph requires that, when using an assist crane, the loads  that will \nbe imposed on the assist crane at each phase of assembly/  disassembly must be verified in accordance with \nSec.  1926.1417(o)(3).  The purpose of this requirement is to avoid exceeding the assist  crane's rated \ncapacity. \"Assist crane\" is defined in Sec.  1926.1401  as \"a crane used to assist in assembling or \ndisassembling a crane.\"  When used for this purpose, an \"assist crane\" is subject to all  applicable provisions \nof this standard, including the requirement of  Sec.  1926.1417(o) that it not be used in a manner that \nexceeds its  rated capacity. (See the discussion of this provision at 73 FR 59745,  Oct. 9, 2008.)      No \ncomments were received on this provision; it is promulgated as  proposed except that the purpose of the \nrequirement is now included  above in the preamble, rather than in the rule text, to increase the  clarity of \nthe requirement. Paragraph (h)(5) Boom and Jib Pick Points     This provision would require the A/D director \nto address the hazard  of using improper boom and jib pick points. Specifically, the points of  attachment of \nrigging to a boom/jib or boom/jib section(s) must be  suitable for preventing structural damage. Such damage \ncould compromise  structural integrity and, in some cases, may not be immediately  noticed. If that \ncomponent were nonetheless used, the boom/component  could fail.     The points of attachment also \nneed to facilitate the safe handling  of these components. (See the discussion of this provision at 73 FR  \n59745, Oct. 9, 2008.) No comments were received on this provision; it  is promulgated as proposed. Paragraph \n(h)(6) Center of Gravity      In a variety of instances the method used for ma intaining stability  during \nassembly/disassembly depends on supporting or rigging a  component (or set of components) so that it \nremains balanced throughout  the process. In such instances the A/D director is required to identify  the \ncenter of gravity of the load. (See the discussion of this  provision at 73 FR 59745, Oct. 9, 2008.) No comments \nwere received on  this provision. It is promulgated as proposed ex cept for one  grammatical change. \nParagraph (h)(7) Stability Upon Pin Removal     This paragraph requires that each of the following must be \nrigged  or supported to maintain stability upon the removal of the pins: Boom  sections, boom suspension \nsystems (such as gantry A-frames and jib  struts), and components. \"Boom suspension system\" is defined in \nSec.   1926.1401 as \"a system of pendants, running ropes, sheaves, and other  hardware which supports the \nboom tip and controls the boom angle.\"  This definition is the same as that for \"boom suspension\" in the  \nSC&RF Handbook. (See the discussion of this provision at 73 FR 59745,  Oct. 9, 2008.)      No comments \nwere received on this provision; it is promulgated as  proposed except that the conjunctive \"and\" is \nsubstituted for \"or\"  to make it clear that all three of the listed items (boom sections,  boom suspension \nsystems, and components) must be properly rigged, not  just any one of those.  Paragraph (h)(8) Snagging     \nAs explained in the preamble to the proposed rule, \"snagging\"  occurs when pendant cables hung alongside \nthe boom are caught  (\"snagged\") on the pins, bolts, or keepers as the operator raises the  boom (see 73 FR \n59746, Oct. 9, 2008.) Snagging could damage the cables  or other equipment and result  in injury. This \nparagraph requires that  suspension ropes and pendants not be allowed to catch on the boom or  jib \nconnection pins or cotter pins (including keepers and locking  pins). The definition for pendants can be found \nin Sec.  1926.1401.",

See also Associated Builders and Contractors, 2010 WL 276669 *3 (OSHA's  adoption of \nconsensus specifications for safe operation of cranes  \"conforms with an intelligible principle\" and is therefore \nvalid). To  require OSHA to independently determine and codify every safety  procedure for every \nconfiguration of every make and model of crane or  other equipment covered by this standard, as well as every \nattachment  or device that could be used with that equipment, would be unrealistic,  inefficient, and \ncontrary to all jurisprudence on this issue. In light  of C -DAC's recommendations to include manufacturer \nprocedures in  subpart CC, and based on the record as a whole, OSHA concludes that  requiring compliance \nwith manufacturer procedures is an efficient and  appropriate means of ensuring safe maintenance, assembly \nand  disassembly, configuration, and operation of equipment covered by this  subpart. Therefore, OSHA is \nincorporating manufacturers' procedures and  recommendations into Sec.  1926.1417, and several other \nprovisions of  this standard, where the Agency determines that it is the most  effective and appropriate way \nto accomplish the OSH Act goals.      Two commenters objected to OSHA's inclusion of manufacturer  \n\"recommendations\" in the definition for equipment criteria. (ID- 0205.1; -0213.1.) The commenters, however, \nprovide no justification for  distinguishing manufacturer recommendations from other manufacturer  \nprocedures. C-DAC determined that manufacturer recommendations were an  appropriate means of ensuring \nthe safe use of equipment, and OSHA  agrees. Manufacturer recommendations, like procedures, specifications,  \nprohibitions, etc., instruct the user how to use the equipment safely  and in a manner most consistent with \nthe equipment's design.      Moreover, there is nothing novel in OSHA's relianc e on manufacturer  \nrecommendations. A number of OSHA standards already require compliance  with manufacturer \nrecommendations. See, e.g., Sec.  1910.134,  Respirator protection; Sec.  1910.184, Slings. As noted above, \nthe  former crane standard (in former S ec.  1926.550(a)) replaced by this  final rule included a broad \nprohibition based solely on manufacturer  recommendations: \"Attachments used with cranes shall not exceed \nthe  capacity, rating, or scope recommended by the manufacturer.\" Yet no  court has invalidated an OSHA \nstandard requiring compliance with  manufacturer recommendations, even though several containing such  \nlanguage have been challenged. The commenters offer no new compelling  legal arguments for why OSHA \nshould delete provisions requiring  compliance with manufacturer recommendations, and do not identify a  \nmeaningful distinction between a manufacturer's recommendation,  procedure, instruction, or specification. \nAccordingly, OSHA is  requiring compliance with manufacturer recommendations as proposed.      Finally, \nwith respect to the suggestion to permit alternate  procedures provided they are \"consistent with\" \nmanufacturers'  procedures, the Agency concludes that amending this p rovision in that  manner would be \nunacceptable because it would lead to uncertainty over  what procedures are \"consistent with\" the \nmanufacturers' recommended  procedures. Therefore, this provision is promulgated as proposed. Paragraph \n(b) Unavailable Oper ation Procedures     Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, in the event that the  \nmanufacturer procedures for operation are unavailable, the employer  will be required to develop procedures \nnecessary for the safe operation  of the equipment and its attachments. The employer will also be  required \nto ensure compliance with such procedures. \"Unavailable  procedures\" is defined in Sec.  1926.1401 as \nprocedures that are no  longer available from the manufacturer, or have never been available  from the \nmanufacturer. For instance, procedures that are in the  employer's possession but are not on the job site, \nwould not be  considered unavailable under Sec. Sec.  1926.1417(b) and  1926.1441(c)(2), where the same \nterm is used.     An example of a situation where procedures might be unavailable is  old equipment where \nthe manufacturer is no longer in business. Even  where the original manufacturer became part of another",

The Agency \nconcludes that general industry's permanently installed  overhead and gantry cranes should be covered under \ngeneral industry  standards rather than the final construction crane standard, even if  they perform \nincidental construction work (see discussion of Sec.   1926.1400, Scope). However, all other general industry \ncranes, whether  mobile or permanently installed, are covered under the final standard  to the extent that \nthey perform construction work.      Several general industry sectors that commented in the rulemaking  \nwill not be affected by the final standard because their only  interaction with construction consists of making \ndeliveries of  materials to the ground at construction sites. Several commenters noted  that their industry \nonly made deliveries to the ground. (ID-0236; - 0299.1.) The Agency has made clear in the Scope section above \nthat the  delivery process from truck to ground is not considered to be a  construction activity covered by its \nconstruction standards. For that  reason, brick manufacturers, pre -cast concrete products manufacturers,  \nand all other distributors of similar supplies are not affected by the  standard because they only deliver \nmaterials from truck bed to ground.      However, the Agency views deliveries into or onto structures  \ndifferently--as construction activity within the purview of the  standard. Therefore, industries t hat deliver \nmaterials into or onto  structures with articulating cranes are included in the industry  profile. The final \nstandard exempts such deliveries for articulating  cranes with automatic overload protection devices (AOPDs). \nIf all such  articulating cranes had these devices, then affected industries  (building supply, lumber yards,",

Also, this paragraph requires this meeting to \nbe repeated when an  employee is newly assigned to the operation. The purpose of this  requirement is to \nmake all employees involved in the personnel hoisting  operation aware of the requirements of this section \nand the plan for  the personnel lift. This provides an opportunity for all employees  involved to have a \ncommon and complete understanding of the hoisting  operation and to give uniform information and \ninstructions immediately  prior to the lift. This addresses hazards which result from  misunderstanding of the \nrequirements, particular lift conditi ons or  procedures. no comments were received on this provision; it is  \npromulgated as proposed. Paragraph (n) Hoisting Personnel Near Power Lines      This paragraph prohibits \nhoisting personnel within 20 feet of a  power line 350 kV and below or within 50 feet of a power line over 350  \nkV, except for work that is covered by 29 CFR part 1926, subpart V,  Power Transmission and Distribution.     \nThe p urpose of this requirement is to establish a safe clearance  distance from power lines to protect \nemployees from an electrocution  hazard that could result if the personnel, a personnel platform, or  \nequipment makes electrical contact with a power line. The clearance  distances are similar to those in Sec. Sec.  \n1926.1407 and 1926.1408  for equipment operating near power lines. However, under Sec. Sec.   1926.1407 \nand 1926.1408, clearances less than 20 and 50 feet are  permitted for certain voltage ranges. However, C-DAC \ndetermined that  when personnel are hoisted near a power line it is necessary to require  the minimum \ndistances of 20 feet for lines 350 kV or less and 50 feet  for lines over 350kV. Note that all other requirements \nin subpart CC  regarding power line safety must also be met, including Sec. Sec.   1926.1406-1409. No \ncomments were received on this provision; it is  promulgated as proposed. Paragraph (o) Hoisting Personnel \nin Drill Shafts     This paragraph provides requirements when hoisting personnel in  drill shafts that are 8 \nfeet and smaller in diameter . Drill shafts of  this size may be either too small to use a personnel platform, or \nuse  of a personnel platform might not allow the room needed to perform the  necessary work. Therefore, \ndue to the limitations of a drill shaft of  this size, use of a personnel platform would typically be infeasible  \nand a boatswain's chair may be the only practical means of hoisting  personnel and performing the necessary \nwork.     One commenter stated that personnel should not be hoisted into a  drill shaft unless the employer \ndetermined that use of a video camera  was both impractical and infeasible. (ID -0120.0.) However, this  \ncommenter did not provide any explanation or supporting documentation  of how this would improve safety \nbeyond what the proposed rule  required. As discussed at paragraph (a) of this section, equipment may  be \nused to hoist personnel only when all other means of reaching the  work area presents a greater hazard or is \nnot possible because of the  project's structural design or worksite conditions.     Because no information \nwas provided to justify an additional  restriction on an employer, OSHA is promulgating th is provision as  \nproposed.     Section 1926.1431(o)(1) allows the employer to use either a  personnel platform or a \nboatswain's chair for hoisting personnel.\\126\\  When an employer elects to use a boatswain's chair instead \nof a  personnel platform, particular supplementary requirements in paragraph  (o)(3) must be met. Those \nrequirements address the heightened danger  that the employee may fall from the chair or contact the wall \nof the  drill shaft. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\126\\ Note that, under Sec.  \n1926.1431(a), an employer may only  use equipment to hoist personnel when other means of reaching the  \nwork area would present a greater hazard or would not be possible  because of the project's structural design \nor worksite conditions.  Therefore, before using either means to hoist personnel in drill  shafts, the employer \nwould need to determine and demonstrate that  hoisting personnel instead of using other means of access to \nthe  work area is the least hazardous, or the only, means to gain access  to the work area. -----------------------",

OSHA agrees \nwith  these comments and has added these requirements to the final version  of Sec.  1926.1433(c).      \nAnother commenter suggested that the standard require equipment  manufacturers to obtain independent \nverification that the prototype  testing was performed. (ID-0156.1.) C-DAC addressed the prototype  issues \ndirectly and did not recommend this approach. Based on the  evidence in the record, the Agency is not \nconvinced that placing this  burden on the manufacturer is warranted.  Paragraph (d)     Paragraph (d) of",

Paragraph (e)(4) requires the platform to support its own weight  plus a \nminimum of five times the maximum intended load without failure.  C-DAC selected this minimum limit \nbecause it would provide an adequate  margin of safety for employee protection from structural failure of the  \nplatform. The guardrail system and personal fall arrest system  anchorages are not subject to this requirement \nbut instead are subject  to Sec.  1926.1431(e)(6).      Paragraph (e)(5) requires that welding of any part of \nthe platform  or its component parts be performed by a welder who is certified and  familiar with the weld \ngrades, types and material specified in the  particular platform's design. This requirement  is designed to \nprevent  structural failure of the platform due to improper welding.      Paragraph (e)(6) details the \nrequirements of the platform for  guardrails, fall arrest anchorage points and enclosure of the platform  \nbetween the toeboard and mid -rail. Proper guardrails and fall arrest  anchorage points are critical fall \nprotection devices, and the required  platform enclosure is needed to protect employees below from falling  \nobjects. In addition, points to which personal fall arrest systems are  attached must meet the anchorage \nrequirements in 29 CFR part 1926  subpart M.     Paragraph (e)(7) requires the placement of a grab rail \nwithin the  entire perimeter of the personnel platform except for access gates/ doors where a grab rail can be \nimpractical. The grab rail provides a  place for the employee to hold onto while in the platform instead of  \nusing a guardrail as a hand hold. Using a guardrail as a hand hold  exposes the employee's hand to being \nsmashed by external objects.     No comments were received on paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(7); they  are \npromulgated as proposed.      Paragraphs (e)(8)(i) and (ii), Access gates/doors, specifies that  access \ngates/doors must be designed to not swing outward and must also  have a mechanism that will keep the  \ngate/door from being opened  unintentionally.     One commenter, a platform manufacturer, stated that \ngenerally their  platforms have doors that do not swing outward. (ID-0238.1.) However,  for certain custom \nplatforms, such as a one-person platform, the size  and design of the platform makes it unsafe for a person to \nenter the  platform and close the gate behind the occupant when it is an inward  swinging gate. The \ncommenter indicated that for this type of platform,  the gates are designed to swing outward to provide safe \naccess for the  individual. To protect against accidental opening of the gate, a  positive latching system is \nincluded with an o utward swinging gate.     The Agency agrees that certain types of personnel platforms \ncould  be of a size or configuration that would necessitate an outward  swinging access gate or door to allow \nfor safe entry and egress of an  occupant. Therefore, OSHA h as revised this paragraph to include an  \nexception for this type of platform. When it is infeasible to have an  inward swinging gate due to the size or \ndesign of the platform, the  gate can swing outward. However, the additional feature of a positive  latching \nor similar system that prevents accidental opening must be  included. This conforms with the intent of this \nrequirement to prevent  an occupant from falling from the platform due to an access gate or  door opening \nunexpectedly.     Paragraph (e)(9) requires adequate headroom to allow employees to  stand upright in the \npersonnel platform. This provides adequate space  for the employee to work from the platform while keeping \nhis/her entire  body within the platform, and contributes to greater stability during  platform movement. No \ncomments were received on this provision; it is  promulgated as proposed.     Paragraph (e)(10) requires \nan overhead protective cover attached to  the platform when an employee is exposed to falling objects. It  \nmandates the overhead cover of the platform to be of such material and  design to provide visibility for both \nthe operator and the employees on  the platform, while maintaining adequate protection from falling  \nobjects. The reference to a wire mesh with \\1/2\\ inch openings is an  example of a type of material and design \nthat could be used for the  platform cover. The nature of the worksite conditions and likely type  of falling",

(ID -0156.1.)  Another advocated \nemployer qualification of riggers. (ID -0197.1.)     OSHA acknowledges that synthetic slings have cert ain \nadvantages,  such as preventing damage to equipment components, and no commenters  advocated a \nprohibition in all instances. OSHA has therefore decided  not to prohibit the use of synthetic slings in \nassembly/disassembly.  There must, however, be adequate safeguards for their use.     OSHA agrees with \nthe comment that stressed the importance of  inspecting slings. However, as Sec.  1926.251(a)(1) already \nrequires  that all rigging equipment be inspected, no additional requirement is  needed in subpart C C \nregarding the inspection and removal of synthetic  slings.     The Agency finds that it is vital that synthetic \nslings be  protected from abrasive, sharp or acute edges, since any of those  conditions can damage a \nsynthetic sling, resulting in a failure. Also,  based on its review of the record, the Agency concludes that such  \nslings must be protected from configurations that could cause  compression or distortion of the sling, since",

The chief purpose of  the analysis is to demonstrate feasibility while providing a measure \nof  the size of the rule, its possible impact on industries and the  economy, and the ability to weigh and \ncompare its costs and benefits.  The analysis is not trying to predict wi th precision exactly the  outcomes \nunder the rule, which depend on employer compliance, changes  in technology and the way employers react \nto the new standard, and many  other factors.     The Agency is taking a somewhat different approach to \nestimating  the risk reduction under the crane standard. OSHA's current  construction crane standards were \nadopted in 1972 under the OSH Act's  sec. 6(a), permitting the Agency to adopt existing standards and  \ncurrent consensus standards without informal rulemaking. Thus, for  example, former Sec.  1926.550(b)(2) \nreferred to the ANSI B30.5 -1968  standard (that is, from the year 1968) for requireme nts for design,  \ninspection, testing, and maintenance of crawler, locomotive, and truck  cranes. The current standards were \nwidely believed to be out of date  and ineffective; hence, the creation of the Negotiated Rulemaking  \nCommittee (C-DAC) from affecte d industries and labor representatives to  address weaknesses.     For \nexample, the former construction crane standard had in former  Sec.  1926.550(a)(15)(i) a prohibition from \nworking within 10 feet of  any energized overhead power line. Yet power line c ontact causes more  crane-\nrelated employee deaths than any other source, and the negotiated  rulemaking committee produced \nprovisions that are meant to reduce those  fatalities. Technically, however, one could argue that it is a failure  \nto comply with the current standard that results in electrocutions. If  the crane, boom, wire, or load were not \ngetting closer than 10 feet to  power lines, there would be no electrocutions. The final standard  increases \nthe prohibited distance to 20 feet, but also includes  a  number of other precautions. California recently \nincreased the  prohibited distance to 20 feet, and reported that electrocutions due to  cranes have fallen \nfrom five over a two and one-half year period prior  to the regulation to just one in the same period of time \nafterward. The  reduction in the California fatalities also can be attributed to a  requirement for operator \ncertification; this final OSHA standard also  includes this requirement.     The Agency concludes that its final \nstandard will result in fewer  fatalities and injuries due to a number of the provisions in the final  standard, \neven though there are some existing construction crane  provisions that address the same risk. This is \nattributed to more  specific precautions in particular sections of the rule as well as the  requirement for \ncertifying crane operators, which potentially affects  safety in all aspects of crane operations.      Another \nexample where the final standard will be more protective  than current standards is in assembly/disassembly \noperations. Assembly/ disassembly operations are, along with power line contact, a leading  cause of fatalities \nin crane work. Technically, one could argue that  these fatalities could always be avoided by compliance with \nthe current  crane standard--to follow manufacturers' specifications--which is a  general, passive, and non-\nspecific duty. The final standard has lengthy  provisions in the final standard to prevent these types of \naccidents.     OSHA believes that these types of accidents will be prevented by  compliance with the \nprovisions of this final standard for assembly and  disassembly of equipment. Section 1926.1403 requires that \nequipment be  assembled in compliance with manufacturer procedures or with  alternative employer \nprocedures designed to prevent the equipment from  collapsing. In addition, under Sec.  1926.1404, \nassembly must be  conducted under the supervision of a person wh o understands the hazards  associated \nwith an improperly assembled crane and is well-qualified to  understand and comply with the proper assembly \nprocedures. Section  1926.1404(f) would prohibit employees from being under the boom when  pins are \nremoved. In situations where site constraints require an  employee to be under the boom when pins are",

Like all product  manufacturers, crane manufacturers want satisfied \ncustomers and repeat  business, and OSHA has no basis to conclude, as the commenters suggest,  that they \nwill alienate their customers by recommending unnecessary  procedures that will reduce the usefulness and \nproductivity of their  products. Moreover, there are sound reasons to determine that following  \nmanufacturer procedures will result in both the safe and productiv e use  of cranes. The manufacturer of a \nlarge and complex piece of machinery  such as a crane is thoroughly familiar with the machine's design,  \ncomponents, and capabilities and is well-positioned to develop the  procedures that enable the crane to be \nused effectively and safely. The  commenters provided no basis for OSHA to conclude that allowing crane  \nusers to pick and choose which manufacturer recommendations to follow  will promote safety, and OSHA does \nnot believe this is the case.  Moreover, C-DAC's members had vast experience in crane manufacturing  and \nuse and were well-positioned to determine whether compliance with  manufacturer's recommendations will \npromote crane safety. They  concluded that it would. In the absence of additional evidence, OSHA  defers to \nC-DAC's experience.     OSHA also finds no merit in the building industry representative's  assertion that \ncompliance with manufacturer recommendations should not  be required because manufacturers \"over -\nwarn\" out of liability  concerns. The best way for manufacturers to avoid liability for  accidents involving their \nproducts is to recommend the precautions that  are needed to prevent such accidents, so their concern for \ntort  liability is fully consistent with the objective of this standard.     Regarding the delegation of authority \nissue, OSHA notes that  provisions similar to this one, including provisions in the prior  cranes standard in \nformer Sec.  1926.550, have withstood judicial  scrutiny on every occasion on which they have been \nchallenged.\\83\\ See,  e.g., Associated Builders & Contractors v. Miami -Dade County, 594 F.3d 1321;  \nAssociated Builders & Contractors, Inc. v. Brock, 862 F.2d 63, 68 -69  (3d Cir. 1988); Towne Con str. Co. v. \nOccupational Safety & Health  Review Comm'n, 847 F.2d 1187, 1189 (6th Cir. 1988) (finding the  physical \nimpossibility of requiring OSHA independently to set safety  standards for every industry job classification and \nindustrial  substance in th e country justifies reliance on the fruits of private  efforts as governmental \nstandards). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\83\\ Among the many OSHA \nstandards requiring compliance with  manufacturer information are: Sec.  1910.134, UI; Sec.  1910.184,  \nSlings; Sec.  1910.265, Sawmills; Sec.  1915.113, Shackles and  hooks; Sec.  1910.217, Mechanical power \npresses; Sec.  1926.451,  Scaffolds: General requirements; Sec.  1926.302, Power -operated hand  tools; \nand Sec.  1917.43, Powered industrial trucks.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \nThe requirement in Sec.  1926.1417(a) to comply with  manufacturers'  operating procedures is essentially \nthe same as that imposed by former  Sec.  1926.550(a)(1) of the prior rule. As the commenter from the  \nbuilding industry notes, former Sec.  1926.550(a)(1) was upheld against  a challenge that requiring \ncompliance with manufacturer's  specifications and operating limitations is an illegal delegation of  authority \nto private persons. (ID-0232.1, citing Towne Construction, 12  BNA OSHC 2185 (OSHRC 1986) aff'd 847 F.2d \n1187 (6th Cir. 1988).) The  Review Commission and the Sixth Circuit found that the prior rule's  delegation to \nmanufacturers was circumscribed by other regulatory  requirements governing the design and construction \nof cranes. (See,  e.g., 12 BNA OSHC at 2186 noting design specifications in 29 CFR  1910.180(c)(1) applied to \ncranes covered by former Sec.  1926.550.)",

During such operation, the  \nequipment can act as an antenna and become energized by the  electromagnetic signal emitted from the \ntower. As proposed, Sec.   1926.1408(f) stated that when the equipment is close enough for an  electrical \ncharge to be induced in the equipment or load, the  transmitter must be deenergized or the following \nprecautions taken: The  equipment must be grounded, and non -conductive rigging or an insulating  \nlink/device must be used.      Previously, subpart N, at former Sec.  1926.550(a)(15)(vii),  required that \nwhen equipment is close enough to a transmitter tower for  an electrical charge to be induced, the equipment \nhad to be grounded  and a ground jumper cable used to connect the load to the equipm ent. In  addition, \nnonconductive poles having large alligator clips or other  similar protection had to be used to connect the \nground jumper cable to  the load. Connecting the load to the grounded equipment dissipated any  electrical \ncharge induced in the load. The Committee determined that  subpart CC's proposed requirement for \nnonconductive rigging or an  insulating link instead of grounding the load better reflected current  industry \npractice and better protected employees.     The requirement for nonconductive rigging or an insulating link \nin  proposed Sec.  1926.1408(f) was a fundamentally different approach than  requiring a ground jumper \ncable to be connected to the load as was  specified in former Sec.  1926.550(a)(15)(vii). The latter connects \nthe  load to a ground, while proposed Sec.  1926.1408(f) would have  insulated the load from the \nequipment or employees handling the load.      The Agency requested public comment on whether the \nproposed  requirement was preferable to that in former Sec.   1926.550(a)(15)(vii). Some commenters \nagreed that the proposed  requirements would provide better protection of workers and argued that  they \nwere more feasible than the requirements of former Sec.   1926.550(a)(15)(vii). (ID-0205.1; -0213.1.) One \ncommenter believed that  Sec.  1926.1408(f) as proposed was inferior to former Sec.   1926.550(a)(15)(vii) \nbecause \"insulating links are generally rated for  distribution voltages and would not properly protect \nemployees working  near power lines.\" \\53\\ (ID-0209.1.) Another commenter recommended  that the \nproposed Sec.  1926.1408(f) requirements be supplemented with  a requirement that any insulating link \nused be rated for the applicable transmission tower frequencies, and that nonconductive tag lines be  used. -\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\53\\ Another commenter opposed the \nproposed language because it  believed that grounding the equipment under the provisions of former  Sec.  \n1926.550(a)(15)(vii) would better protect employees, the  crane, and the power line because it would result \nin a very quick  trip of the line. (ID-0144.1.) This comment is not relevant because  grounding the crane would \nnot cause the transmitter or communication  towers to trip. ----------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------      The problem addressed by these comments involves how to protect a  worker, such as a rigger, \nwho may come into electrical contact with the  load. Under the proposed rule, the load would be  insulated \nfrom the  grounded crane to isolate the load from circulating current that could  cause it to be energized. \nHowever, it may be possible that the load  itself could become energized by absorbing energy from the \ntransmitter  or communication tower. The former rule addresses this possibility by  requiring an electrical \nconnection between the load and the (grounded)  equipment. However, in the event there is either a poor \nelectrical  connection or a ground that is not fully effe ctive, this method might  not provide complete \nprotection. Therefore, OSHA has decided not to  require either precaution, but instead to require that any tag \nline  used be nonconductive. This precaution is required in other provisions,  discussed above, to protect the \nrigger from the possibility that the  equipment may come into electrical contact with a power line. It will  be",

As discussed under paragraph (b)(3), a commenter recommended that  \nthe requirement of paragraph (c)(3)(ii) should be explicitly referenced  in the monthly inspection reports, and \nOSHA has made an addition to  paragraph (b)(3) to accomplish this. (ID -0226.) Also, as discussed  under \nparagraph (a)(4)(i)(B), OSHA is adding a requirement to paragraph  (c)(3)(i)(B) that at least two full wraps of \nwire rope must remain on  the drum when the load and/or boom is in its lowest position.

Sec.   \n1926.1433(d)(1) through (d)(13) of this section. The issues listed in  paragraph (d) are addressed by ASME \nB30.5-2004. However, as explained  in the proposed rule, C -DAC determined that these requirements were  \nalso appropriate for other equipment, and the proposed rule applied  them to all equipment (see 73 FR 59843-\n59845, Oct. 9, 2008). The Agency  did not receive any comments opposing this approach. Therefore, instead  \nof applying these requirements solely to mobile and locomotive cranes,  paragraph (d) applies them to all \nequipment covered by this subpart.      Section 1926.1433(d)(1), Load capacity/ratings and related  \ninformation, requires the employer to ensure that the information  available in the cab (see Sec.  \n1926.1417(c)) regarding load capacity/  ratings and related information include the data listed in Sec. Sec.   \n1926.1433(d)(1)(i) through (d)(1)(xvi). These equipment specifications  need to be made available for the \noperator to reference in the cab so  that the operator has immediate access to information needed to ensure  \nsafe operation.     Section 1926.1433(d)(2) requires that load hooks (including latched  and unlatched \ntypes), ball assemblies and load blocks be of sufficient  weight to overhaul the line from the highest hook \nposition for boom, or  boom and jib lengths, and the number of parts of the line in use. This  requirement is \nnecessary to prevent any incidents that could occur when  ball assemblies, load blocks, and load hooks are of \ninsufficient weight  to keep the load line from being unintentionally pulled up the boom due  to the weight \nof the load line itself.     Section 1926.1433(d)(3) requires that hook and ball assemblies and  load blocks \nbe marked with their rated capacity and weight. Marking  this equipment with their rated capacities and \nweights is needed to  help ensure that they are not overloaded and is necessary to help  enable employers \nto comply with proposed Sec.  1926.1433(d)(2).      Section 1926.1433(d)(4), Latching hooks, requires that \nhooks meet  the requirements in Sec. Sec.  1926.1433(d)(4)(i) -(ii) of this  section.\\129\\ Section \n1926.1433(d)(4)(i) requires that hooks be  equipped with latches, except where the requirements of Sec.   \n1926.1433(d)(4)(ii) are met. It also requires that latches close the  throat openings of hooks and that they be \ndesigned to retain slings or  other lifting devices/accessories in the hooks when the rigging  apparatus is slack. \nThis requirement is included to ensure that the  rigging will not be unintentionally dislodged from the hook \nwhen the  rigging apparatus is slack.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\129\\ \nPursuant to a commenter's suggestion on the structure of  this section as proposed (ID-0172.1), this section \nwas reorganized  in the final rule for clarity but was not changed substantively. ---------------------------------------\n------------------------------------      Section 1926.1433(d)(4)(ii) prohibits hook s without latches, or  with \nlatches removed or disabled, from being used unless two criteria  are met. First, to ensure that the hazards \nare weighed appropriately, a  qualified person must determine that it is safer to hoist and place the  load \nwithout latches (or with the latches removed/tied-back). Second,  routes for the loads must be pre-planned \nto ensure that no employee is  required to work in the fall zone except for employees necessary for  the \nhooking or unhooking of the load. The reason for generally  requiring hooks to be equipped with latches is to \nprevent the load from  accidentally disengaging from the hook. C -DAC determined that the use  of hooks \nwith latches is an industry recognized practice, but also  recognized that there are some circumstances where \nthe use of a hook  with a latch presents a greater hazard. The exceptions in Sec.   1926.1433(d)(4)(ii) are \nincluded to address the latter circumstances.",

Such employees are only permitted to \noperate cranes under the  conditions specified in Sec.  1926.1427(f), and the proposed rule  required them \nto be trained in the operator certification/qualification  criteria provided in Sec.  1926.1427(j).      Because \nthe certification and qualification requirements of Sec.   1926.1427 will not be phased in until four years after \nthe effective  date of the standard, see Sec.  1926.1427(k), OSHA specified in the  preamble to proposed \nparagraph (c)(1) that operator training during  this phase-in period would likewise be required to address the \ncriteria  in Sec.  1926.1427(j) (see 73 FR 59826, Oct. 9,  2008).     To clarify its intent in the final rule OSHA \nhas split proposed  paragraph (c)(1) of this section into three separate paragraphs, (c)(1)  through (3), and \nrenumbered proposed (c)(2) as (c)(4). Revised  paragraph (c)(1) is intended to apply after the four-year phase \nin  period to employees who must be certified, or qualified, under Sec.   1926.1427 and are training to do \nso for the first time, and to  employees who are training for re -certification/re-qualification. These  \nemployees, who will only be permitted to operate the equipment as  \"operators in training\" and subject to \nseveral conditions, must be  trained in the areas addressed in Sec.  1926.1427(j) (criteria for  operator \ncertification testing).     Paragraph (c)(1) also requires employer s to provide the necessary  additional \ntraining if the operator-in-training does not pass a  qualification or certification test. C-DAC determined, and \nOSHA agrees,  that it is important for an employer to provide the training necessary  for its operators to be \nqualified or certified as required by this  subpart.     C-DAC selected the criteria in Sec.  1926.1427(j) as \nthe minimum  knowledge and skill requirements nece ssary for safe operation of  equipment. OSHA is \ntherefore requiring training in the same areas to  ensure consistency with the certification/qualification \nprocess and to  develop the trainee's knowledge and skills in the areas that the record  reflects are critical to \nthe safe operation of equipment.      New paragraph (c)(2) addresses training during the 4 -year phase-in  \nperiod in the same way for the same people as in paragraph (c)(1): Each  must be trained in the areas \naddressed in Sec.  1926.1427(j). Alt hough  the certification/qualification requirements do not apply until \nfour  years after the effective date of this standard, OSHA concludes that it  makes sense for two reasons to \ntrain employees in the same areas that  they will need to master to pass th e certification/qualification  \nexaminations: (1) It will facilitate their preparation for the  examination, and (2) these areas have been \nidentified in the record as  the minimum knowledge and skill sets that all operators should possess.      \nParagraph (c)(3) applies to operators of equipment covered by this  subpart but are expressly excepted from \nthe certification and  qualification requirements of Sec.  1926.1427. This includes those  operators for \nwhom the qualification or certification requirements of  Sec.  1926.1427 do not apply based on the type of \nequipment being  operated. Section 1926.1427(a) provides: \"Exceptions: Operator  qualification or \ncertification under this section is not required for  operators of derricks (see Sec.  1926.1436), sideboom  \ncranes (see Sec.   1926.1440), and equipment with a maximum manufacturer-rated hoisting/ lifting capacity \nof 2,000 pounds or less (see Sec.  1926.1441).\" For  the same reasons that the Agency has concluded that \nthe operator  certification/qualification criteria in Sec.  1926.1427 are not  appropriate for these operators, \nthe Agency concludes that training on  the same Sec.  1926.1427(j) criteria would also not b e necessary.  \nInstead, these operators, must be trained in the safe operation of the  type of equipment they will be \noperating.",

Paragraph  \n(g)(3)(iii) provides that the derrick must not be used unless the  competent person determines that the test \nhas been passed.     Paragraph (g)(4), Documentation, requires that tests conducted  under this paragraph \nmust be documented. The d ocument must contain the  date, test results, and the name of the tester. The \ndocument must be  retained until the derrick is re-tested or dismantled, whichever occurs  first. Because a \nload test meeting the criteria listed in the standard  is so important  to the safe use of the derrick, C -DAC \ndetermined that  documentation of the test was needed to show that the test had been  conducted properly. \nSection 6-2.2.2(a)(1) of ASME B30.6-2003 similarly  requires that a written report of the load test be prepared \nand  maintained. OSHA received no comments on this paragraph. OSHA is adding  language to clarify that all \ninspection documentation must be available  to inspectors in accordance with Sec.  1926.1412(k).  Paragraph \n(h) Load Testing Repaired or Modified Der ricks     Paragraph (h) of this section requires that derricks that \nhave had  repairs, modifications, or additions affecting the derrick's capacity  or safe operation be evaluated \nby a qualified person to determine if a  load test is necessary. If so, load  testing must be conducted and  \ndocumented in accordance with Sec.  1926.1436(g). Subpart N, through  incorporation of section 6-2.3.3 of \nANSI B30.6 -1969, required all  replaced and repaired parts to have at least the original safety  factor. \nHowever, there was no explicit requirement to load test the  derricks after parts were repaired or replaced. \nASME B30.6-2003 does  address load testing of repaired, altered or modified derricks in  section 6-2.2.2(b), \nspecifying that the need for such a test be  determined by a qualified person. Paragraph (h) is consistent with \nthe  ASME requirement. Such testing will help the employer identify safety  defects in a repaired or modified \nderrick prior to its actual use. No  comments were received for (h); it is promulgated as proposed. Paragraph \n(i) [Reserved.] Paragraph (j) Power Failure Procedures      Paragraph (j) of this section requires the derrick \noperator to  safely stop operation if the power fails during operations and lists  additional steps that must be \ntaken. Section 1926.1436(j)(1) requires  setting all brakes or locking devices. Section 1926.1436(j)(2) requires  \nmoving all clutch and other power controls to the off position. These  steps wi ll prevent inadvertent \nmovement of the load during the power  outage or upon restoration of power. These precautions are found \nin  section 6-3.2.3(h) of ANSI B30.6-1969 and are reiterated in ASME B30.6- 2003. No comments were received \nfor (j); it is promul gated as proposed.  Paragraph (k) Use of Winch Heads      Paragraph (k) of this section \nspecifies minimum requirements for  the safe use of a winch during hoisting operations. Paragraph (k)(1)  \nrequires that ropes not be handled on a winch head without the  knowledge of the operator. Section \n1926.1436(k)(2) requires the  operator to be within reach of the power unit control while a winch  head is \nbeing used.

No \ncomments were  submitted on this paragraph; it is therefore promulgated as proposed.  Paragraph (s)      \nEach time an operator handles a load that is 90% or more of the  maximum line pull, Sec.  1926.1417(s) \nrequires the operator to test the  brakes by lifting the load a few inches and applying the brakes. In  duty \ncycle and repetitive lifts where each lift is 90% or more of the  maximum line pull, this requirement applies to \nthe first but not to  successive lifts, because the operator would have already determined  from the initial \ntest that the brakes are sufficient. The brake test  required by this paragraph is designed to ensure that the \nbrakes are  sufficient to handle loads close to their design capacity before  lifting the load high off the ground. \nNo comments were submitted on  this paragraph, and it is promulgated as proposed. Paragraph (t)     This \nparagraph requires that neither the load nor the boom be  lowered below the point where less than two full \nwraps of rope remain  on their respective drums. This provision is designed to ensure that  the rope is not \nunspooled to the point where the rope would become  disconnected from the drum. No comments were \nsubmitted on this  provision, and it is promulgated as proposed.  Paragraph (u) Traveling With a Load      \nParagraph (u)(1) of this section prohibits traveling with a load if  the practice is prohibited by the manufacturer. \nIf the manufacturer  does not prohibit this practice, the equipment may travel with a load,  but only if the \nrequirements of paragraph (u)(2) are met. Paragraph  (u)(2) of this section sets forth three procedures that \nemployers would  have to follow when traveling with a load: a competent person must  supervise the \noperation; the determinations of the competent person  must be implemented; and for equipment with tires, \nthe tire pressure  specified by the manufacturer must be maintained.     During discussions of this issue, C-\nDAC members noted the dynamic  effects of traveling with a load impose additional and/or increased  forces \non crane components. Unless the crane has been designed to  handle these types of forces and force levels, \nthey can cause component  failure, collapse, instability or overturning. The Committee concluded  that the \nmanufacturer has the expertise to ascertain its equipment's  capabilities. Th erefore, the Committee \nrecommended that where the  manufacturer has prohibited traveling with the load, the operator must  \ncomply with such a determination to ensure safety. (For additional  explanation, see 73 FR 59794, Oct. 9, 2008.) \nNo comments were sub mitted  on these provisions and they are promulgated as proposed.  Paragraph (v)     \nThis paragraph requires that rotational speed of the equipment be  such that the load does not swing out \nbeyond the radius at which it can  be controlled. Like paragraph (q ) of this section, discussed above,  this \nprovision is designed to prevent the hazard of sideloading, which  occurs when the load swings to either side \nof the boom tip, rather than  its appropriate position directly beneath the boom tip. When the load  is not \ndirectly under the boom tip, sideloading occurs and decreases  capacity. This hazard can lead to tip -over or \nboom failure. No comments  were submitted on this paragraph, and it is promulgated as proposed. Paragraph \n(w)     This paragraph requires that a tag or restraint line be used if  necessary to prevent the load from \nrotating if that would be hazardous.  No comments were submitted on this paragraph, and it is promulgated \nas  proposed. Paragraph (x)     This paragraph requires that the brakes be adjusted in accordance  with \nmanufacturer procedures to prevent unintended movement. This  requirement applies to all brakes on \nequipment covered by this  standard, including brakes used to control the lowerin g of the load and  those \nused to stop the equipment while it is traveling. C-DAC noted  that improper adjustment can cause a delay in \nthe onset of braking  after the operator attempts to activate the brake and can also diminish  the brake's \ncapacity. Brakes are critical to the safe operation of the  equipment and must be properly adjusted to serve",

One \ncommenter suggested that each wrap of the rope is a crossover  point such that the crossover points will line \nup across the face of  the drum. (ID-0121.) The Agency disagrees with this view. As defined in  the standard, \na crossover point occurs \"where one layer of rope climbs  up and crosses over the previous layer * * *.\" While \nthe rope climbs  up at the drum's flange, it does not climb up as it then spools across  the previous (lower) \nlayer towards the other flange, i.e., as it wraps  across the face of the drum.

Sec.  1926.1413(a)(3)(iv) and (a)(3)(v) (\"Wire rope adjacent to  end \nconnections\" and \"Wire rope at and on equalizer sheaves\") are  functionally equivalent to items requiring \nspecial scrutiny during the  annual inspections required in proposed Sec. Sec.   1926.1413(c)(2)(ii)(C) and (F) \n(\"Wire rope in contact with saddles,  equalizer sheaves or other sheaves where rope travel is limited \" and  \n\"Wire rope at or near terminal ends\").

In 1988,  \nformer Sec.  1926.550(g) was added to establish clearly the conditions  under which employees on personnel \nplatforms may be hoisted by cranes  and derricks (see 53 FR 29116, Aug. 2, 1988). In 1993, former Sec.   \n1926.550(a)(19) was added to require that all employees be kept clear  of lifted and suspended loads.      \nConsiderable technological advances have been made since the 1971  OSHA standard was issued. For example, \nhydraulic cranes were rare at  that time, but are now prevalent. In addition, the construction  industry has \nupdated the consensus standards on which the original OSHA  standard was based. For example, the industry \nconsensus standard for  derricks was most recently updated in 2003, and that for crawler,  locomotive and \ntruck cranes in 2007.      In recent years, a number of industry stakeholders asked the Agency  to update \nsubpart N's cranes and derrick requirements. They were  concerned that accidents involving cranes and \nderricks continued to be  a significant cause of fatal and other serious injuries on construction  sites and \nbelieved that an updated standard was needed to address the  causes of these accidents and to reduce the \nnumber of accidents. They  emphasized that the considerable changes in both work processes and  \ntechnology since 1971 made much of former Sec.  1926.550 obsolete.      In response to these requests, in",

The DOT licensing was provided as an  example of how \nState licensing, when required as part of a general  Federal compliance scheme, has been \"used in the past to \nprevent fatal  and other serious accidents that result when operators lack the  knowledge and skills needed \nto operate safely.\" Id. The only other  example of successful third-party certification provided as a basis for  \nthe certification requirement was another government licensing  requirement: Ontario's licensing \nrequirements for crane operators. Id.  The combination of OSHA's exclusive reliance on these examples and \nthe  government licensing provision in proposed Sec.  1926.1427(e) provided  clear notice that the \ngovernment licensing provision might develop  along the lines of the examples. While several commenters \nsubmitted  comments supporting mandatory compliance with government licenses,  thereby indicating that \nat least these parties viewed the mandatory  compliance as a possible outcome of the rulemaking, none of \nthe  commenters objected to the government licensing provision or questioned  the validity of their tests. \nThe Agency's choice to make compliance  with paragraph (e) mandatory, rather than optional, flows logically  \nfrom the proposal, the comments, and the discussion at hearing. See  National Mining Ass'n v. Mine Safety \nand Health Admin., 512 F.3d 696,  699 (DC Cir. 2008) (noting that the logical outgrowth test takes into  \naccount the comments, statements and proposals made during the notice - and-comment period).     The \nAgency's decision to mandate compliance with State and local  laws is not new. OSHA already relies on State \nlicensing requirements in  its respirator standard when it provided for \"a licensed health care  professional\" \nto perform a medical evaluation of an employee's ability  to use a respiratory (see Sec.  1910.134(e)). This \nportion of the  standard was challenged and upheld in American Iron Steel and Steel  Institute v. OSHA, 182 \nF.3d 1261, 1278 (11th C ir. 1999). OSHA's choice  to mandate compliance with State or local law is also \nconsistent with  the approach of other agencies. (See, e.g., Department of  Transportation regulations \nrequiring State licensing of commercial  drivers, discussed in the preamble to the proposed rule at 73 FR 59810,  \nOct. 9, 2008.)  Paragraph (a)(2) Options for Certification or Qualification Where  License Not Required by a \nGovernment Entity     As noted above, where a State or local license is not required,  employers have three \nchoices for certification of operators. Those  choices are set out in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section \nand  discussed in detail below. It is important to note that these options  will not satisfy the requirements of \nSec.  1926.1427 for operation of  equipment within a State or local government's jurisdiction when that  \ngovernment entity has it's own licensing requirements that satisfy the  criteria in paragraphs (e) and (j) of this \nsection. Paragraph (a)(3) Exceptions     The exceptions in the proposed rule were for types of equipment  \nthat are specifically excluded from the qualification/certification  requirement under sections of this standard \nthat pertain to that  equipment, including derricks (see Sec.  1926.1436), sideboom cranes  (see Sec.  \n1926.1440), and equipment with a rated hoisting/lifting  capacity of 2,000 pounds or less (see Sec.  \n1926.1441).     A labor representative pointed out that the excep tion in Sec.   1926.1441 applies to \nequipment with a \"maximum manufacturer -rated\"  hoisting/lifting capacity of 2,000 pounds or less, and it \nasked that  this same language be used in Sec.  1926.1427(a) to avoid suggesting  that the exception might \napply to larger equipment when it is  configured to have a rated capacity of 2,000 pounds or less. (ID-0341.)  \nOSHA agrees that the suggested change better reflects the intent of the  provision and has modified the \nlanguage of Sec.  1926.1427(a) in the  final rule by replacing the word \"rated\" with \"maximum rated.\" OSHA  \nnotes that this change does not change the substantive requirements of  the rule in any manner.

The  Agency determines that cranes need anti two-\nblock devices to prevent employees  from being dropped and to prevent loads from striking employees in the \nconfined  work environment of a cofferdam or shaft. These safety considerations outweigh any  concern for \ndamage to a device or unnecessary \"tripping\" during  marine operations.     The temporary alternative \nmeasures available when an anti two -block  device on a lattice -boom crane or derrick malfunctions are to \nclearly  mark the cable so that it can easily be seen by the operator at a point  that will give the operator \nsufficient time to stop the hoist to  prevent two-blocking, or to use a spotter to warn the operator to stop  \nthe hoist.     For telescopic boom cranes, the temporary alternative measures  required are to clearly mark \nthe cable so that it can easily be seen by  the operator at a point that will give the operator sufficient time to  \nstop the hoist to prevent two-blocking and to use a spotter when  extending the boom. OSHA determines that \nthe alternative measures for  telescopic boom cranes must require the use of a spotter when extending  the \nboom because two -blocking can occur even when the cable hoist is  not being operated.  As noted above, \ntelescoping the boom out moves the  boom's block closer to the load end of the hoist cable, which can cause  \ntwo-blocking. A mark on the hoist cable in such instances will not warn  the operator that two -blocking is \nabout to occur. Therefore, when  extending the boom, a spotter is required.     The proposed rule did not \naddress the issue of anti two -block  protection for articulating cranes. Many such cranes are equipped with  \nforks at the end of the boom and do not have the potential for two- blocking. However, those equipped with a \nload hoist present the same  potential for two-blocking as other cranes with load hoists. A trade  association \npointed out that the ASME standard for articulating cranes,  ASME B30.22 -1998, first required two -block \nprotection effective  December 31, 1999. (ID-0206.1.) OSHA infers that articulating cranes  with boom hoists \nmanufactured after December 31, 1999, were routinely  equipped with automatic two-block protection after \nthat date.  Therefore, to treat such cranes in a manner similar to lattice boom  cranes and telescopic boom \ncranes, OSHA is adding Sec.   1926.1416(d)(3)(iii) to the final rule. Paragraph (e) Category II Operational Aids \nand Alternative Measures.     Paragraph (e) of this section lists the req uired Category II  operational aids \nand the acceptable temporary alternative measures for  these aids. If any of these aids is not working properly, \nit must be  repaired no later than 30 days after the deficiency occurs. As noted  above, if the employer \ndocuments that it has ordered the necessary  parts within 7 calendar days from the occurrence of the \ndeficiency, and  does not receive the part in time to complete the repair in 30 calendar  days, the repair must \nbe completed within 7 calendar days of receipt of  the part. (For purposes of clarification, the Agency has \nadded a  reference to Sec.  1926.1416(e) noting that the requirements of Sec.   1926.1417(j) are applicable. \nSee further discussion at Sec.   1926.1417(j).)     Boom Angle or Radius Indicator: Paragraph (e)(1) requires \na boom  angle or radius indicator that is readable from the operator's station  on all equipment. Section \n1926.1401 defines \"boom angle indicator\" as  \"a device which measures the angle of the boom relative to the  \nhorizontal.\" This definition is identical to that in the SC&RF  Handbook. It is necessary to know the boom angle \nto determine the  crane's capacity from its load chart. The temporary alternative measure  is to measure the \nradii or boom angle with a measuring device.",

The  following discussion will primarily focus on the differences between  \nthe proposed rule and this final rule.      OSHA stresses the provisions in this section are additional  \nrequirements that must be met when equipment is used to hoist  personnel. During such use, all other \napplicable requirements of this  subpart must be met.  Paragraph (a)      This paragraph states that \nequipment may be used to hoist personnel  only when all other means of reaching the work area present a \ngreater  hazard or is not possible because of the project's structural design or  worksite conditions. It reflects \nOSHA's longstanding recognition that  using cranes and derricks to lift personnel is inherently hazardous and  \nshould only be done when it is either the least hazardous means or  when, in light of the configuration of the \nworksite, it is the only  means of performing required work.      This paragraph does not apply to work \ncovered by 29 CFR part 1926  subpart R, Steel Erection. Subpart R, at Sec.  1926. 753(c)(4), allows  the use \nof equipment to hoist personnel in a platform that complies  with subpart CC without the need for a showing \nthat other means of  reaching the work area would create a greater hazard or is impossible.  OSHA's reasons \nfor including this exception in subpart R are discussed  in detail in the preamble to the steel erection standard \n(66 FR 5196,  5209, Jan. 18, 2001).     One commenter asserted that employers engaged in work covered \nby 29  CFR part 1926 subpart V, Power Transmission and Distribution, should be  allowed to use equipment \n(with a boom attached platform) to hoist  personnel without showing that other means of reaching the work \narea  creates a greater hazard or is not possible. (ID -0144.1.) This  commenter bases this assertion on the \npremise that many manufacturers  offer a platform specifically designed to attach to the tip of the boom  \nwhich may include platform mounted controls. The commenter believes  that when using this type of platform, \nthe equipment \"essentially  transforms the crane into a large aerial lift.\"      The Agency finds this \ncomparison unpersuasive. As stated above,  equipment covered by this section is primarily designed for \nhoisting  materials, not people. C-DAC concluded that it was important to  differentiate between equipment \nprimarily designed for moving  personnel, such as an aerial lift, as compared to equipment that is  primarily \ndesigned to lift materials. In the judgment of th e Committee,  a personnel platform attached to equipment \ncovered by this section  presented a greater hazard than a machine that is designed for moving  personnel. \nTherefore, the proposed rule would have required an employer  to show that another means of reaching the \nwork area presents a greater  hazard or is not possible. OSHA agrees, and is retaining the same  substantive \nrequirement in the final rule.      Upon review of this provision, the Agency realized the use of the  word \n\"worksite\" in the phrase, \"conventional means of reaching the  worksite\" could be misleading. The Agency has \nchanged the phrase to  \"conventional means of reaching the work area.\" The term worksite  could be \ninterpreted to mean the entire construction worksite. This  requirement is about an employee working in a \nparticular area or place  on a larger worksite. OSHA finds the use of the phrase \"work area\" to  provide \ngreater clarity. Therefore, the provision is promulgated as  proposed incorporating this terminology change. \nParagraph (b) Use of Personnel Platform     Paragraph (b)(1) of this section generally requires the use of a  \npersonnel platform when hoisting employees and requires that criteria  specified in Sec.  1926.1431(e) be \nmet for such platforms. Paragraph  (b)(2), Exceptions, sets forth the construction activities in which  hoisting \npersonnel without using a personnel platform is allowed. These  activities are: hoisting employees into and \nout of drill shafts 8 feet  and smaller in diameter, pile-driving operations, marine worksites,  storage tanks \n(steel or concrete), shaft operations and chimney  operations. OSHA considers the use of a personnel platform \nin these  situations to be generally infeasible or more hazardous than other  means. This section contains",

OSHA solicited public comment on the \navailability of load -weighing  or rated capacity devices for dedicated pile drivers and the related  issue of \nwhether a date other than one year after the effective date of  this standard would be an appropriate date for \napplication of this  requirement. OSHA received no public comment regarding the phase -in  requirements. \nThe Agency changed the words \"this standard\" to \"Subpart CC\"   in the final rule. With the exception of the \nclarification, this provision  is promulgated as proposed.  Paragraph (d)     Paragraph (d) of this section \nprovides that for Sec.  1926.1433,  only paragraphs (d) and (e) of Sec.  1926.1433 apply to dedicated pile  \ndrivers. Paragraphs (d) and (e) of Sec.  1926.1433, Design,  construction and testing, are applicable to all \nequipment covered by  this subpart, whereas the other provisions are applicable to specific  types of \nequipment and are not relevant to dedic ated pile drivers. (See  discussion in Sec.  1926.1433 for further \nexplanation.)     In the proposed rule this paragraph referred to Sec. Sec.   1926.1433(e) and (f); this was a \nclerical error. For the proposed rule,  Sec.  1926.1433 had been renumbered fr om what was in the C -DAC  \nconsensus document, but paragraph (d) did not get updated accordingly.  OSHA has made this correction in \nthe final rule. With the exception of  the corrected referencing, this provision is promulgated as proposed.  \nDeletion of Proposed Paragraph (e)      The Committee concluded that there was no reason to exclude  \ndedicated pile drivers from the requirements of Sec.  1926.1427,  Operator qualification and certification. \nThe Committee was concerned,  however, that because of the relatively few dedicated pile drivers in  use, \nthere would not be adequate market demand to support the  availability of certification testing specific to \nsuch equipment. For  the same reasons, the Committee was concerned about the availability of  auditors for \nauditing employer qualification programs for dedicated  pile driver operators. C-DAC concluded that any lack \nof qualification  or certification services specific to dedi cated pile drivers would be  alleviated by allowing \nqualification or certification on similar  equipment, so proposed paragraph (e) of this section read:       \nSection 1926.1427 (Operator qualification and certification)  applies, except that the qualificat ion or \ncertification shall be for  operation of either dedicated pile drivers or equipment that is the  most similar to \ndedicated pile drivers.      After reviewing comments regarding Sec.  1926.1427, OSHA decided to  add \nlanguage similar to proposed Sec.  1926.1439(e) to Sec.  1926.1427.  See discussion of Sec.  \n1926.1427(b)(2). In light of that change, OSHA  has decided that it is not necessary to include proposed Sec.   \n1926.1439(e) in the dedicated pile driver section of the final rule.  The concerns addressed by that paragraph, \nas proposed, are now dealt  with in Sec.  1926.1427(b)(2), which covers dedicated pile drivers as  well as \nother types of equipment covered by subpart CC.  Section 1926.1440 Requirements for Sideboom Cranes      \n\"Sideboom crane\" is defined in Sec.  1926.1401 as \"a track -type  or wheel -type tractor having a boom \nmounted on the side of the tractor,  used for lifting, lowering or transporting a load suspended on the load  \nhook. The boom or hook can be lifted or lowered in a vertical direction  only.\" No comments were submitted \non this definition; it is  promulgated as proposed. (See the discussion in the proposed rule  explaining this \ndefinition at 73 FR 59868, Oc t. 9, 2008.)      This section identifies which of the other sections of the final  \nrule apply to this equipment and sets additional requirements. The  limited requirements for sideboom cranes, \ncompared to the requirements  for other types of cranes, reflec t the particular construction and  limited \nfunctions of sideboom cranes.",

Until that point, it would remain under Sec.   1926.1416(d)(1)(ii), and at least one \nof the measures in paragraphs  (d)(1)(A)-(C) would be required at all times.      Luffing Jib Limiting Device: \nParagraph (d)(2) requires that  equipment with a luffing jib have a luffing jib limiting device. As  defined in \nSec.  1926.1401, a luffing jib limiting device \"is similar  to a boom hoist limiting device, except that it limits \nthe movement of  the luffing jib.\" These devices function similarly and are  distinguished only as to the type \nof crane extension they are designed  to limit automatically, the jib or the boom. The temporary alternative  \nmeasures for a luffing jib limiting device are the same as those for a  boom hoist limiting device in paragraphs \n(d)(1)(i)(A)-(C). For clarity,  the Agency added the words, \"rather than the boom hoist\" to paragraph  (d)(2)(i).     \nAnti Two-Blocking Device: Paragraph (d)(3) sets forth the  requirements for anti two-blocking devices. Section \n1926.1401 defines  \"two-blocking\" as \"a condition in which a component that is  uppermost on the hoist line \nsuch as the load block, hook block,  overhaul ball, or similar component, comes in contact with the boom  tip,",

(ID -\n0137.1.)     C-DAC thoroughly discussed the necessary qualifications for an A/D  director and determined \nthat the best option for ensuring employee  safety during assembly/disassembly was to require  an A/D \ndirector to be  both a qualified and a competent person. (See ID-0321.5.) Furthermore,  the terms qualified \nperson and competent person and their definitions  are well established and well recognized in the \nconstruction industry.  For these reasons, OSHA is deferring to the judgment of the Committee  and is not \nmaking the suggested change. Paragraphs (b) Knowledge of the Procedures and (c) Review of the  Procedures     \nSection 1926.1404(b) requires that the A/D director understand the  assembly/disassembly procedures. In \naddition, Sec.  1926.1404(c)  requires the A/D director to review the procedures immediately prior to  \nstarting the process unless the director's experience in having used  them on the same type and configuration \nof equipment, and recollection  and understanding of the procedures is such that it makes their review  \nunnecessary.     These two sections work together to ensure that an experienced A/D  director understands \nthe procedures. Even if an A/D director has  experience, he/she must still meet the knowledge requirement \nin Sec.   1926.1404(b). For example, if an A/D director configured a type of  crane a number of years ago and \nno longer remembers the procedures  applicable to such a crane, he/she does not fall within the experienced  \nA/D director exception, and must, accordingly, review the procedures  immediately prior to starting the \nprocess.     No comments were received on these provisions. They are promulgated  as proposed except \nthat, in addition to a grammatical clarification,  Sec.  1926.1404(c) now contains a clearer knowledge \nrequirement to  clarify the interplay between Sec. Sec.  1926.1404(b) and 1926.1404(c),  as described \nabove. Paragraph (d) Crew Instructions      Under this provision, before beginning assembly/disassembly  \noperations, the A/D director would have to ensure that the crew members  understand their tasks and the \nassociated hazards, as well as any  hazardous positions/locations that they need to avoid.     No comments \nwere received on this provision. It is promulgated as  proposed except that \"ensure\" replaces \"determine,\" to \nbetter  represent the role of the A/D director. Paragraph (e) Protecting Assembly/Disassembly Crew Members \nOut of  Operator View     Section 1926.1404(e) requires that before a crew member goes to a  location \nthat is out of view of the operator and is either in, o n, or  under the equipment, or near the equipment (or \nload) where the crew  member could be injured by movement of the equipment (or load), the  crew member \nmust inform the operator that he/she is going to that  location. Where the operator knows that a cr ew \nmember went to a  location covered by paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the operator  must not move any \npart of the equipment (or load) until the operator  is informed in accordance with a pre-arranged system of \ncommunication  that the crew member is in a safe position. An example of such a system  would be the use \nof a signal person who gives an all-clear signal to  the operator once the signal person sees that the employee \nhas exited  the hazard area. Another example would be where the employee in the hazard  area is equipped \nwith a portable air horn and, in accordance with a pre - arranged horn signal system, sounds an appropriate \nsignal to the  operator that the employee has exited the hazard area. To be effective,  the pre-arranged signal \nsystem needs to be designed so that this all- clear signal could not be confused with a horn signal from some \nother  employee for another purpose.      One of the hazards identified by the Committee is an operator  \nswinging or moving the crane/derrick when assembly/dis assembly  personnel are in a crush/caught -in-\nbetween zone and out of the  operator's view. The Committee concluded that an effective and  practical \nmeans of preventing these accidents would be through a  communication procedure that would provide key \ninformation to, and  coordination between, the operator and these workers.

Paragraph (c)(4)(i) requires training in \nthe testing of the boom hoist  brake on friction equipment prior to moving a boom off a support to  \ndetermine whether the brake requires adjustment or repair. The purpose  of this procedure is to ensure that \nthe brake is sufficient before the  boom is at too great an angle or height. Using this procedure, if the  brake \nis deficient, the boom will fall only a short distance. This  provides an additional safety measure related to the \nhazards resulting  from an uncontrolled boom. Moving the boom when the brake is not  working properly \ncan result in uncontrolled lowering of the boom, which  can endanger workers in the proximity of the hoisting \nequipment.  Paragraph (c)(4)(i) also requires similar training for testing the  brake on all other equipment \nwith a boom. Again, this procedure  provides an additional safety measure related to the hazards resulting  \nfrom an uncontrolled boom. For clarity, the Agency has added a  reference to Sec. Sec.  1926.1417(f) and (j) \nfor additional  requirements related to tag-out procedures and communication for any  necessary repairs. \nSee discussion of these requirements above at  Sec. Sec.  1926.1417(f) and (j).      Paragraph (c)(4)(ii) \nrequires the operator to be trained in the  manufacturer's emergency procedures, when available, for \nstopping  unintended equipment movement. This provides another level of  protection to minimize \nemployee injury resulting from unintended  equipment movement. OSHA recognizes that manufacturer's \nemergency  procedures for halting unintended equipment movement may not always be  available and \ntherefore this training is required only when the  procedures are available.     One commenter requested \nthat more specialized training, such as  model-specific training, should be required for newly hired operators  \nor operators assigned to new or di fferent models of equipment. (ID- 0199.1.) OSHA determines that the rule \naddresses this commenter's  concern. An operator qualified or certified under Sec.  1926.1427 has  shown \nthat he/she is qualified to operate any type of equipment covered  by the qualification/certification. Others \nmust be trained in the type  of equipment they are operating under paragraph (c) of this section.      \nParagraph (d) of this section, Competent persons and qualified  persons, requires competent persons and \nqualified persons to be trained  regarding the requirements of this subpart applicable to their  respective \nroles.     A person assigned by an employer to be a \"competent person\" or  \"qualified person\" under this \nrule must already have had a certain  level of training (or, in the case of a competent person, either  training \nor experience) to meet the criteria applicable to such a  designation. This paragraph does not address such \ntraining--it does not  require the employer to provide the training needed for an employee to  meet the \ncriteria to become a competent or qualified person. The sole  purpose of this paragraph is to require the \nemployer to ensure that  both competent persons and qualified persons are trained on the  requirements of \nthis subpart applicable to the person's role and  responsibility. For example, under Sec.  1926.1430(d), a \n\"competent person\"  assigned to conduct shift inspections required in Sec.  1926.1412(d) must  be trained \nin the required elements of a shift inspection. This training  is necessary to ensure that the competent person \nor qualified person is  aware of his/her role under this subpart regarding finding/correcting  hazardous \nconditions.     Another example is maintenance and repair personnel, who may  operate equipment under \nlimited conditions necessary to perform the  maintenance or repair (see Sec.  1926.1429(a)). Such an \nemployee must  be a \"qualified person,\" Sec.  1926.1429(b), and must be trained in  accordance with Sec.  \n1926.1430(d) to operate the equipment as  necessary to perform the maintenance or repair. The Agency notes,  \nhowever, that maintenance and repair workers are not considered  \"operators\" for the purposes of paragraph \n(c) of this section and are  therefore not required to be trained in all of the areas addressed in  Sec.  \n1926.1427(j), or as required under Sec.  1926.1427(c)(3).

(ID-0141.2.) This \nstudy tested the efficacy of two  proximity alarm models under various simulated construction condition s.  \nThe study indicated that the accuracy of the proximity alarms could be  adversely affected by such factors as: \n(1) Operating the equipment with  a boom angle and length significantly different than that used for the  \ndevice's last sensitivity adjustment; and (2) operating the equipment  on sites with multiple overhead power \nlines, especially where those  power lines had differing voltages or involved intersecting  installations. Two \nother commenters also questioned the efficacy of  proximity alarms. (ID-0118.1; -0206.1.)     OSHA shares \nthe concerns expressed by NIOSH and other commenters  over the accuracy of currently available proximity \nalarms.\\49\\ However,  such concerns are addressed by the definition of \"proximity  alarm\" in  Sec.  \n1926.1401, which states that the term refers to a device \"that  has been listed, labeled, or accepted by a \nNationally Recognized  Testing Laboratory in accordance with Sec.  1910.7.\" To be so listed,  labeled, or \naccepted, the Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory  (NRTL) must determine that the device works \nproperly by concluding that  it conforms to an appropriate test standard. Accordingly, no proximity  alarm \ncan be listed, labeled, or accepted by a Nationally Recognized  Testing Laboratory (NRTL) in accordance with \nSec.  1910.7 until the  problems identified by the commenters have been rectified. OSHA  concludes that \nretaining this option in the final rule will provide an  incentive for proximity alarm manufacturers to improve \nthese devices to  the point where they will meet the definition's criteria. -----------------------------------------------\n----------------------------      \\49\\ Neither of the proximity alarm models tested in the NIOSH  study had \nobtained NRTL listing, labelin g, or acceptance.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \nIn situations where an employer chooses the option of using a  dedicated spotter, the employer is required to \nmeet the requirements  for spotters in Sec.  19 26.1408(b)(4)(ii). As specified in Sec.   1926.1408(b)(4)(ii)(A), \nthe spotter has to be equipped with a visual  aid to assist in identifying the minimum clearance distance.      \nUnder Sec.  1926.1408(b)(4)(ii)(B) -(D), the spotter has to be  positioned so that he/she can effectively gauge \nthe clearance distance  from the power line; the spotter, where necessary, must use equipment  that enables \nhim/her to communicate directly with the equipment  operator; and the spotter must give timely information \nto the operator  so that the required clearance distance can be maintained.      Some commenters \nrecommended that dedicated spotters be required at  all times. (ID-0112; -0113.) OSHA declines to impose \nsuch a  requirement. The Agency determines that allowing the employer to choose  from a variety of options \nfor this second layer of protection allows  the employer to select a method that it believes would be suitable,  \nincreases the likelihood of employer compliance, and will be an  effective approach to reducing power line \nrelated injuries and  fatalities.     One commenter also advocated adding a provision requiring dedicated  \nspotters to pass a visual acuity exam. (ID-0071.) OSHA determines that  it is unnecessary to require a specific \nlevel of visual acuity.  Wherever this standard requires an employer to have an individual  perform a \nparticular task, that duty is met only where the individual  has the ability to perform the task. If an employer",

Section \n1910.179(b)(2)  requires cranes manufactured after August 31, 1971, to comply with the  design \nspecifications in American National Standard Safety Code for  Overhead and Gantry Cranes, ANSI B30.2.0 -\n1967. As discussed below,  equipment manufactured after September 19, 2001, must comply with the  \nupdated provisions of ASME B30.2 -2001. Section 1926.1438(b)(2)(ii)(C)  is a transi tional provision covering \nequipment manufactured between  August 31, 1971 and September 19, 2001. OSHA has made minor \ngrammatical  revisions to (b)(2)(ii)(C) for clarity.     Paragraph (b)(2)(iii) incorporates several sections of the \n2001  version of ASME B30.2 into this section. Previously, ANSI B30.2.0 -1967  applied through subpart N's \nformer Sec.  1926.550(d).

In the Federal \nRegister notice, OSHA asked for public comment on  whether interests other than those listed would be \nsignificantly  affected by a new rule. It also solicited requests for membership on  the Committee. OSHA also \nurged interested parties form coalitions to  support individuals identified for nomination to the Committee.      \nThe Agency noted that the need to limit the Committee's membership  to a number that coul d conduct \neffective negotiations may result in  some interests not being represented on the Committee. OSHA further  \nnoted that interested persons had means other than Committee membership  available to participate in the \nCommittee's deliberations, including  attending meetings and addressing the Committee, providing written  \ncomments to the Committee, and participating in Committee workgroups  (see 67 FR 46612, 46615, Jul. 16, \n2002).     In response to its request for public input, the Agency received  broad support for using \nnegotiated rulemaking, as well as 55  nominations for committee membership. To keep membership to a  \nreasonable size, OSHA tentatively listed 20 potential committee  members, and asked for public comment on \nthe proposed list (see 68 FR  9036, Feb. 27, 2003). In response to the comments, OSHA added three members  \nto the committee --individuals from the mobile crane manufacturing  industry, the Specialized Carriers & \nRigging Association, and the  outdoor advertising industry (see 68 FR 39879, Jul. 3, 2003).

Under \nthe final stand ard, delivery of materials onto or into  the structure, such as setting components, is a \nconstruction activity  covered under the final standard. SBCA did not mention the use of  articulating cranes, \nwhich with a lifting movement limiting device,  would in fact exempt their equipment from the standard, and \nthus OSHA  concludes that these affected industries are only employing boom  trucks. The Agency, based on \nSBCA's comment, concludes that the primary  affected industries are NAICS 321213 Engineere d Wood \nMember (except  Truss) Manufacturing and NAICS 321214 Truss Manufacturing. Engineered  Wood Member \nManufacturing has 162 establishments and 51,270 employees  (2006 CPB and SUSB). Truss Manufacturing has \n1,085 establishments and  51,270 employees. According to the 2008 Occupational Employment Survey,  the \nfour-digit NACIS 32120 Veneer, Plywood, and Engineered Products  industry has 120 crane operators, 2,240 \ndrivers of heavy trucks and  tractor trailers, and 420 drivers of delivery trucks (total employment  of 98,000). \nThe Agency concludes that typical employers in these two  sectors, with about 50 employees, likely employ \none to two boom trucks  for delivery. Truss manufacturers are much more likely to use boom  trucks for \ndelivery and placement of co mponents--and therefore fall  under the scope of the standard --than \nmanufacturers of engineered wood  members, the Agency concludes, because the small equipment typically  \nused by the latter employers would not be capable of lifting heavy  members for placement (ID-0208.1). In \naddition, the relatively few  engineered wood member manufacturers produce specialty items and do not  \nsimply serve more local or regional markets as do truss manufacturers.  The Agency concludes that employers \nin this latter industry are much  more likely to transport their products longer distances and deliver to  the \nground. These products are also more typically used only in larger  residential and commercial applications, \nwhere an on-site crane would  lift and position them for in stallation. As SBCA noted in its comment,  most \ndeliveries are made to the ground. The Agency concludes that, on  average, employers in the Engineered \nWood Member industry employ one  truck-mounted crane and employers in the Wood Truss manufacturing  \nindustry also employ one, on average. According to comments by SBCA,  employers are likely already meeting \nall of the other safety  requirements in the final standard save for crane operator  certification. (ID-0208.1.)      \nA comment by a major shipyard alerted the Agency to the  potential impact of the final construction cranes \nstandard on the  Shipbuilding and Repair Industry NACIS 336611. (ID -0195.1.) When  shipyard cranes \nperform construction activities, they will be covered  by the final standard; alt hough the final standard \nexempts permanently  installed overhead and gantry cranes in general industry. According to  the 2008 \nOccupational Employment Survey, there are 550 crane operators  in the shipyard and boatbuilding industries \n(the four-digit NAICS  33660). Northrup-Grumann in its comment reported that it alone employs  600 cranes \nthroughout its shipyards around the country. (ID -0195.1.)  Northrup-Grumann's 40,000 current employees \nrepresent about one-half of  the employment in the shipbuilding and s hip repair industry, and the  Agency \nestimates that: There are about 1,200 cranes in use in shipyards  and about one -half would be potentially \ncovered by the standard if  construction activities are performed with them, since many large  cranes in \nshipyards are permanently installed. The 1,200 figure is  surely not an underestimate as Northrup-Grumann \nis the largest shipbuilder  in the country and likely the most intense user of cranes for its larger  projects. \nSince construction activities in shipyards are  episodic or irregular,  the Agency estimates that if shipyard \nemployers provide certification for  crane operators for one -half of the number of non -permanent cranes  \n(with 300 certified operators) that would be sufficient to perform  their own construction activities without \nhiring outside construction  contractors for their needs.       The final standard potentially affects the",

If the platform does not have  \ncontrols for the boom and swing functions of the equipment, then it is  essential that the operator be at the \nset of equipment controls which  include these functions, because they are crucial for the safety of  \npersonnel being hoisted. These equipment controls may be on the  platform, in the cab, or on a remote control. \nThe operator must be able  to take immediate action when necessary (such as, for example, when  there is \nunexpected platform or equipment movement, a sudden change in  wind conditions, or an injury to a platform \noccupant). In the final  rule, OSHA has modified Sec.  1926.1431(k)(7)(ii) accordingly .     Paragraph \n(k)(7)(iii) requires the platform's operating manual to  be on the platform or on the equipment while the",

Absent additional \ninformation as to why OSHA should adopt or reference  provisions in the standard the commenter has cited, \nOSHA is unable to  assess whether any such provisions would better address fall protection  issues than the \nprovisions of this final rule.  Section 1926.1424 Work Area Control      Section 1926.1424(a) addresses the \nhazard of employees being  struck, pinched or crushed within the swing radius of the equipment's  rotating \nsuperstructure. Paragraph (a)(1) states that the precautions  in paragraph (a)(2) must be taken when there are \naccessible areas in  which the equipment's rotating superstructure (whether permanently or  temporarily \nmounted) poses a reasonably foreseeable risk of either: (i)  striking and injuring an employee; or (ii) \npinching/crushing an  employee against another part of the equipment or another object.  Paragraph (a)(1) \nis adopted as proposed.      Included in Sec.  1926.1401, Definitions of this rule is the  definition for \n\"upperworks\", which C -DAC identified as a synonym for  the term \"superstructure\", used in the regulatory \ntext of paragraph  (a)(1) of this section, as well as the term \"upperstructure\".     However, two commenters \nnoted that the proposed definition for  \"upperworks\" did not take into consideration the fact that many  \nrough-terrain cranes have the engine mounted in the carrie r, or lower  carriage of the crane, instead of the \nsuperstructure. (ID -0292.1; - 0131.1.) In response, OSHA modified the definition of \"upperworks\" to  \nacknowledge that the presence of an engine is not always a defining  characteristic of that portion of the crane.     \nUnder paragraph (a)(2), the employer is required to institute two  measures to prevent employees from \nentering these hazard areas.  Specifically, under paragraph (a)(2)(i), the employer must train  employees \nassigned to work on or near the equipment in how to recognize  these areas.     Paragraph (a)(2)(ii) requires \nthe employer to erect and maintain  control lines, warning lines, railings, or similar barriers to mark the  \nboundaries of the hazard areas, but contains an exception when such a  precaution is infeasible. If it is neither \nfeasible to erect such  barriers on the ground nor on the equipment, the employer is required  to mark the \ndanger zone with a combination of warning signs and high  visibility markings on the equipment that identify \nthe hazard areas. In  addition, the employer must train employees to understand what those  markings \nsignify.     OSHA received comments advocating an exemption for cranes used in  the railroad industry, \nespecially cranes moving along a track. (ID - 0170.1; -0176.1; -0342.) One commenter suggested that the \nrequirement  for barriers was impractical for cranes moving along a track, as the  barriers would have to be \ncontinually reset.      These objections to the requirement for barriers are not  persuasive. First, the \nrequirement for barriers is not a new  requirement. Former Sec.  1926.550(a)(9) required barricades t o \nprevent  employees from being struck or crushed by the crane, including the  swing radius of the rear of the \nrotating superstructure. The railroad  employers did not provide any evidence that they were unable to \ncomply  with the previous requirement.     Second, the rule already anticipates that for certain equipment \na  traditional type of barrier might not be practical and instead permits  the use of a barrier that attaches \ndirectly to, and will move with, the  equipment.     Finally, paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section permits the \nemployer  to identify these hazard areas with warning signs and high visibility  markings on the equipment \nwhen it is not feasible to erect a barrier on  the ground or the equipment.     Therefore, paragraph (a)(2) is \nbeing promulgated as proposed.     To prevent struck-by and crushed-by injuries and fatalities,  paragraph \n(a)(3) is designed to help protect employees who must  sometimes enter the hazard area to perform work, by \nensuring that there  is adequate communication and coordination between the operator and the  employee \nin the danger area.",

This section starts \nout by explicitly prohibiting equipment from  operating closer than the distances specified in Table A of Sec.   \n1926.1408 to an energized power line except where the employer  demonstrates compliance with the \nrequirements in Sec.  1926.1410.      Note that, in the discussion below of Sec.  1926.1410, references  to \na \"registered professional engineer\" are, in accordance with Sec.   1926.1410(c)(1), references to a registered \nprofessional engineer who  is a qualified person with respect to electrical power transmission and  \ndistribution.     One commenter on the proposed rule asked for clarification  regarding who determines \nwhether a professional engineer is such a  \"qualified person.\" (ID-0155.1.) Under Sec.  1926.1401, a qualified  \nperson is a \"person who, by possession of a recognized degree,  certificate, or professional standing, or who \nby extensive knowledge,  training and experience, successfully demonstrated the ability to  solve/resolve \nproblems relating to the subject matter, the work, or the  project.\" At a given construction site, the employer \nwho is conducting  crane operations and who uses the services of the engineer to carry out  that employer's \nresponsibilities under this section is responsible for  determining whether the registered professional \nengineer is a qualified  person with respect to electrical power transmission and distribution. Paragraphs (a) \nand (b)     These paragraphs set forth prerequisites that must be met for the  employer to be permitted to \noperate equipment closer to a power line  than the applicable Table A of Sec.  1926.1408 distance. Section  \n1926.1410(a) requires the employer to determine that it is infeasible  to do the work without breaching the \nminimum clearance distance under  Table A. If the employer determines it is infeasible to maintain the  Table \nA distance, under Sec.  1926.1410(b) it also has to determine,  after consulting with the utility \nowner/operator, that deenergizing and  grounding the power line, as well as relocating the line, a re  \ninfeasible. See discussion of infeasibility determinations in Sec.   1926.1408(d).     Two commenters \nargued that the requirement to demonstrate  infeasibility was unnecessary for electric utility work regulated \nunder  subpart V. (ID-0203.1; -0209.1.) After careful review of these  comments, OSHA has concluded that it \nis appropriate for subpart V work  to be excluded from the need to show infeasibility under Sec.   1926.1410.     \nSubpart V applies to the erection of new electric transmission and  distribution lines and equipment and the \nalteration, conversion, and  improvement of existing transmission and distribution lines and  equipment (Sec.  \n1926.950(a)(1)). Construction of new lines generally  takes place some distance from existing lines, and the \nlines themselves  are not energized until construction is complete. Hence, clearance  distances are usually \nnot an issue for new c onstruction. However,  alteration, conversion, and improvement of existing lines \nnecessarily  takes place on or near the lines themselves. To enable such work to be  done safely, subpart V \ncontains clearance requirements that permit  equipment to operate m uch closer to the lines than either \nformer Sec.   1926.550 or Sec. Sec.  1926.1408 -1926.1409 of this final rule, as well  as supplementary \nprotective requirements that must be followed when the  subpart V clearance requirements cannot be \nobserved.     Subpart V's clearance requirements are found in Table V-1 of Sec.   1926.950. Subpart V does \nnot require a showing of infeasibility before  allowing subpart V work to comply with these shorter clearance  \ndistances, and OSHA concludes that the record does not s upport  requiring such a showing under the final \nrule either.",

(ID-0206.1.) OSHA  agrees that essential design of the articulating crane precludes the  \nuse of a boom angle indicator. However, to provide some protection  against falling and tipover hazards, OSHA \nhas determined that an  alternative device must be used on articulating cranes when they are  used to hoist \npersonnel. As discussed under Sec.  1926.1400, Scope, the  record indicates that many articulating cranes \nare equipped with  automatic overload-prevention devices. Such a device provides  protection comparable \nto that provid ed by a boom angle indicator, which  helps the operator prevent the crane from becoming \noverloaded by  providing the boom angle information needed to apply the crane's load  chart. Because \noverload protection is particularly vital when equipment  is used to hoist personnel, OSHA is addressing the \ncomment about  articulating cranes by adding Sec.  1926.1431(d)(5)(ii), which  specifies that articulating \ncranes must be equipped with a properly  functioning automatic overload protection device.      No \ncomments were received on the remaining provisions of paragraph  (d)(5); they are promulgated as proposed, \nexcept that Sec. Sec.   1926.1431(d)(5)(ii)-(vi) have been renumbered as Sec. Sec.   1926.1431(d)(5)(iii)-(vii) \nbecause of the addition of new Sec.   1926.1431(d)(5)(ii). Additionally, with respect to paragraph  (d)(5)(vii), \nthe following has been added: \"(See Sec.  1926.1417 for  tag-out and related requirements.)\" This sentence \nhas been added to  ensure the reader is aware of the applicable tag -out and related  requirements of Sec.  \n1926.1417, Operation.     Paragraph (d)(6) prohibits the use of a personnel platform directly  attached to a \nluffing jib. In the experience of C-DAC members, a  complete prohibition of use of a boom-attached personnel \nplatform to a  luffing jib was necessary in light of the range of motion of a luffing  jib and the fact that boom-\nattached personnel platforms are not  designed for attachment to a luffing jib. Thus, only a suspended type  \npersonnel platform may be used on a luffing jib. OSHA defers to the  expertise of the Committee. No \ncomments were received on these  provisions; they are promulgated as proposed.  Paragraph (e) Personnel \nPlatform Criteria     This paragraph establishes the minimum criteria for a personnel  platform. Paragraph \n(e)(1) of this section requires that both the  platform and its attachment/suspension system be designed by a \nqualified  person who  understands structural design and be designed for the particular  function of \npersonnel hoisting. The purpose of this paragraph is to  clearly stipulate that the platform must be designed \nfor employee  safety. This addresses the hazards of structural fail ure of the  platform, failure of the \nattachment/suspension system, and precludes  the use of designs that would be inappropriate for hoisting \npeople.     Paragraph (e)(2) requires the system used to connect the personnel  platform to the equipment \nto be within 10 degrees of level. This  addresses the hazard of platform tipping by maintaining the platform  \nclose to level.",

Such incidents will be redu ced by  compliance with Sec.  1926.1427, Operator \nqualification and  certification and Sec.  1926.1430, Training. Other provisions, such as  those for safety \ndevices and operational aids (Sec. Sec.  1926.1415 and  1926.1416), and the requirement for period ic \ninspections in Sec.   1926.1412, will also reduce these accidents.      Protection against falling from \nequipment is addressed by Sec.   1926.1423, Fall protection. That section requires that new equipment  \nprovide safe access to the operator work station, using devices such as  steps, handholds, and grabrails. Some \nnew lattice-boom equipment must  be equipped with boom walkways. The final standard also contains fall - \nprotection provisions tailored to assembly and disassembly work, and to  other work. Sec tion 1926.1431, \nHoisting personnel, addresses fall  protection when employees are being hoisted.     OSHA has investigated \nnumerous crane accidents that resulted in  fatalities. Below are examples from OSHA's IMIS investigation \nreports  that describe accidents that compliance with this final standard would  prevent.     1. February \n16, 2004: four fatalities, four injuries. A launching  gantry collapsed and fatally injured four workers and sent \nfour other  workers to the hospital. The laun ching gantry was being used to erect  pre-cast concrete \nsegments span by span. The manufacturer required that  the rear legs and front legs be properly anchored to \nresist  longitudinal and lateral forces that act on the launching gantry. The  legs of the launching gantry were \nnot properly anchored. (ID -0017.)     OSHA believes that this type of accident will be prevented by  \ncompliance with the provisions of this final standard for assembling  equipment. Section 1926.1403 requires \nthat equipment be assemble d in  compliance with the manufacturer's procedures, or with alternative  \nemployer procedures (see Sec.  1926.1406) to prevent the equipment from  collapsing. In addition, under \nSec.  1926.1404, assembly must be  conducted under the supervision of a person  who understands the \nhazards  associated with an improperly assembled crane and is well -qualified to  understand and comply \nwith the proper assembly procedures.     2. January 30, 2006. One fatality. An employee was crushed by the  \nlower end section of the lattice boom on a truck-mounted crane while  working from a position underneath \nthe boom to remove the 2nd lower  pin. When the 2nd lower pin was removed, the unsecured/uncribbed \nboom  fell on the employee. (ID -0017.1.)     Section 1926.1404(f) will preve nt this type of accident by  \ngenerally prohibiting employees from being under the boom when pins are  removed. In situations in which \nsite constraints require that an  employee be under the boom when pins are removed, the employer must  \nimplement other procedures, such as ensuring that the boom sections are  adequately supported, to prevent \nthe sections from falling on the  employee.     3. July 23, 2001: One fatality. Employee failed to extend the  \noutriggers before extending the boom of a service -truck crane to lift  pipes. As the employee extended the \nboom, the crane tipped over on its  side, and another employee standing near the t ruck was struck on the  \nhead by the hook block. (ID -0017.10.)     This type of accident will be prevented by compliance with Sec.   \n1926.1404(q), which contains several provisions to ensure that  outriggers and stabilizers are deployed \nproperly before lifting a load.  In addition, the operator qualification and certification requirements  of Sec.  \n1926.1427, which ensure that operators understand and follow  the safety-requirements for the equipment \nthey are operating, will help  prevent this type of accide nt.     4. March 8, 1999. One fatality. Employees \nwere using a mobile crane  to maneuver a load of steel joists. The crane contacted a 7,200 -volt  overhead \npower line, electrocuting an employee who was signaling and  guiding the load.",

For additional discussion of spotter requirements  \nsee the discussion o f Sec.  1926.1407(b)(3)(i) earlier in this  preamble.     Section 1926.1408(b)(4)(iii) \ngives the employer the option of using  a device that automatically warns the operator when to stop \nmovement,  such as a range control warning device. Such a device must be set to  give the operator sufficient \nwarning to prevent encroachment. \"Range  control warning device\" is defined in Sec.  1926.1401 as \"a device  \nthat can be set by an equipment operator to warn that the boom or jib  tip is at a plane or multiple planes.\"     \nFor example: An employer has chosen the option of maintaining a 20- foot distance from the power line. Under \nSec.  1926.1408(b)(4)(iii), it has  chosen to use a range control warning device to help maintain that  \ndistance. The device would have to be set to alert the operator in time  to prevent the boom, load line or load \n(whichever is closest to the  power line) from breaching that 20 -foot distance. As a practical  matter, the \ndevice would have to be set to sound the warning more than  20 feet from the line, since the operator will \nneed some time to react  and to account for the momentum of the equipment, load line and  load.\\50\\ -----\n----------------------------------------------------------------------      \\50\\ One commenter questioned whether range \ncontrol warning  devices exist. (ID-0151.1.) OSHA has confirmed that some cranes are  equipped with such a \ndevice. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      Section 1926.1408(b)(4)(iv) gives the \nemployer the option of using  a device that automatically limits the equipment's range of motion and  is set \nto prevent encroachment. Such a device can be particularly  suitable for tower cranes, for which the swing  \nangle can be programmed  so that the operator cannot move the boom or jib past a certain range.  While it \nmay be more technically difficult to apply swing limitation  devices for use in mobile cranes, the technology \nmay develop so that  they could be used in such cranes as well.     The insulating link option that is available \nunder Sec.   1926.1408(b)(4)(v) would not protect against encroachment but would  provide protection to \nemployees handling the load against electrocution  in the event encroachment did occur. Such a device must \nbe installed  between the end of the load line and the load. When so installed, it  prevents the load from \nbecoming energized in the event the load line or  other part of the equipment makes electrical contact with a \npower line.  Preventing the load from becoming energized helps protect riggers, who  often guide crane \nloads manually and who are therefore at high risk of  being electrocuted if a load becomes energized.      \nSome commenters expressed concern about  the effectiveness of  insulating links. (ID -0206.1; -0378.1.) As \nstated in Sec.  1926.1401,  \"Insulating link/device\" is defined as \"an insulating device that  has been listed, \nlabeled, or accepted by a Nationally Recognized  Testing Laboratory in accordance with Sec.  1910.7.\" This \ndefinition  addresses this concern, since an insulating link used under this  provision must have been found \nby a Nationally Recognized Testing  Laboratory (\"NRTL\") to conform to an appropriate test standard as  \nrequired in Sec .  1910.7.      Because insulating links previously have not been required by any  OSHA \nstandard, OSHA has not yet recognized any testing laboratory as a  NRTL for purposes of insulating link listing, \nlabeling, or acceptance.  A period of time will be needed to review laboratory requests for such  recognition. \nOnce there are NRTLs for testing insulating links, some  time will also be needed for the NRTLs to conduct the \ntests. As a  result, where Sec.  1926.1408(b) applies, Sec.  1926.1408(b)(4)(v) will  be unavailable as an \nadditional measure in the list contained in Sec.",

(ID-0144.1.) A trade association  suggested exempting cranes rated at less than 10 or 15 tons \nfrom the requirement. (ID-0191.1.) It said that these types of cranes are often  used to deliver products to a \njobsite or to place small rooftop HVAC  units on low rise buildings, and that they are used for simple lifts of  \nrelatively light loads. This commenter also requested that OSHA add a  less restrictive certification level for \ncranes rated less than 30  tons, which it said are less complicated to assemble and set up and are  used during \n\"low risk\" lifts.      Another trade association suggested that the threshold for  requiring \nqualification/certification should exclude the 5,000 t o  10,000 pound capacity cranes that its members \ntypically use. (ID - 0189.1.) It said that this equipment is relatively simple to operate,  that the signs its \nmembers install rarely exceed 2,000 pounds, and that  the equipment is used intermittently on the  job and \nonly for brief  periods of time.     A third trade association believes that the size and scope of the  lifts its \nmembers make do not justify the qualification/certification  requirements in the proposed rule and suggested \nalternative  requirements for its members when they operate cranes of less than 35  ton capacity with a \nboom length no greater than 120 feet. (ID -0218.1.)  They ask that their members have the option to self -\nevaluate their  operators after they have gone through a specified train ing program  instead of the third -\nparty certification that would be required under  proposed Option (1). A representative of the building \nindustry made a  similar recommendation for cranes of less than 35 ton capacity with a  boom length no \ngreater than 120 feet. (ID-0232.1.) A small business  representative suggested that OSHA consider exempting \nsome small cranes  (based on vehicle weight or boom length) or routine lifts. (ID-0147.1.)     A witness for \na labor representative testified in opposition to  excluding equipment rated over 2,000 pounds by the \nmanufacturer. He  stated that some low-capacity cranes have long booms and are used to  lift loads to great \nheights, particularly when there is not sufficient  space for a larger crane. (ID-0341.) According to the witness, \nsafety  concerns presented by low capacity cranes with a long boom are as  serious as the concerns \npresented by high capacity cranes. (ID -0341.)  He added that the danger of power line contact was present \nregardless  of the capacity of the crane.      A representative from a crane rental company also testified \nagainst  exempting low-capacity cranes from the qualification/certification  requirement. His company had a \nfleet of cranes ranging from 4 to 600  ton capacity, and in his experience the majority of accidents that his  \ncustomers experienced when they rented cranes but provided their own  operators occurred with cranes \nrated 35 tons or less. (ID-0344.) He was  aware of accidents on residential construction sites that resulted from  \noperating on unsuitable ground, not setting the outriggers properly,  and lifting too heavy a load for the \ncrane's configuration,  deficiencies that he attributed  to operators who did not appreciate the  hazards \ninvolved. (ID -0344.)     OSHA has carefully considered the comments asking for additional  types of \nequipment to be exempted from the qualification/certification  requirements of Sec.  1926.1427. For the \nfollowing reasons, OSHA  declines to add such exemptions to the final rule.     The members of C-DAC, who \nhad vast collective experience in all  aspects of crane operations, reached a consensus that third -party  \nverification was needed to reduce the number of crane accidents and  fatalities in the construction industry. \nThey further determined that  such a requirement should apply to virtually all hoisting equipment,  with only \nthe limited exceptions listed in the proposed rule.",

Therefore, for example, a rubber tired off-\nroad crane  designed for use on tracks would be exempted from Sec.  1926.1402 while  being operated on \nthe tracks, but would be subject to the requirements  of Sec.  1926.1402 if used adjacent to the tracks.  ------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------      \\17\\ See the description of FRA requirements that \nrelate to the  area adjacent to the track roadbed in footnote 11. -----------------------------------------------------------\n----------------  Sections 1926.1403--1926.1406 Assembly and Disassembly      Sections 1926.1403 through \n1926.1406 set out requirements designed  to ensure the safety of employees while equipment is assembled \nand  disassembled (and, in the case of tower cranes, during erecting,  climbing and dismantling). C -DAC \nmembers indicated that, in their  experience, the failure to adequately address hazards ass ociated with  \nthese processes is a significant cause of injuries and fatalities. The  Committee also concluded that the most \neffective way to reduce these  injuries and fatalities would be to have a standard that  comprehensively \naddresses these hazards (s ee also the Agency's  discussion of fatality data associated with \nassembly/disassembly at 73  FR 59741-59742, Oct. 9, 2008).     Note that the term \"procedures,\" which is \nused in the assembly/  disassembly provisions, is defined to include (but is not limit ed to)  instructions, \ndiagrams, recommendations, warnings, specifications,  protocols and limitations (see Sec.  1926.1401). The \noperation of an  \"assist\" crane used to help in the assembly/disassembly process is  not covered by the \nassembly/disassembly requirements but is covered by  the other sections of this standard.\\18\\ ------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------      \\18\\ However, the rigging requirements in Sec. Sec.   \n1926.1404(r) and 1926.1425(c)(3) apply to the rigging used by the  assist crane. --------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------      One commenter suggested that the A gency clarify whether Sec. Sec.   \n1926.1403 through 1926.1406 apply to activities that modify or increase  the height of the crane such as \n\"jumping.\" (ID-0156.1.) \"Jumping\"  (or \"climbing\") refers to the process of adding mast sections to a  tower \ncrane to increase its height.",

As noted  in the preamble to the \nproposed rule, the Committee exemp ted sideboom  cranes from the requirements of these four sections \nbecause the  Committee determined that, in light of the limited capacity and  relative simplicity of operation \nof sideboom cranes, these requirements  would be unnecessary (73 FR 59868, Oct. 9, 2008).     During the \nSBREFA process, one Small Entity Representative (SER)  raised a question as to whether small sideboom cranes \nincapable of  lifting above the height of a truck bed and with a capacity of not more  than 6,000 pounds \nshould be covere d by the proposed rule. This SER  recommended that these small sideboom cranes be \nexempted from the scope  of subpart CC. Accordingly, OSHA asked for public comment about the  \nappropriateness of such an exemption (see 73 FR 59868, Oct. 9, 2008).  Two commenters responded to this \nissue. (ID-0205; -0213.) Both  commenters expressed their belief that such equipment should be  exempted \nfrom the final rule unless the equipment is being used outside  the parameters of the equipment's design, but \nneither commenter  provided any explanation as to why the final rule should exempt such  equipment. (ID-\n0205; -0213.) As discussed above, OSHA decided to exempt  sideboom cranes from several provisions of the \nfinal rule. Absent any  justification to provide additional relief for small -capacity sideboom  cranes, OSHA \nconcludes that the exemptions already provided in the  final rule are appropriate, and will ensure the safety \nof workers who  operate these cranes.  Paragraph (b)     This paragraph addresses the hazards posed by \nboom free fall (that  is, \"live\" booms). As noted above in the discussion of Sec.   1926.1426 (Free fall and \ncontrolled load lowering), in general, the use  of equipment with live booms is prohibited. However, \nequipment  manufactured before the ANSI B30.5 series prohibited live booms may use  live booms under \nconditions specified in Sec.  1926.1426(a)(2). The  prohibition in Sec.  1926.1426 applies to equipment \nmanufactured on or  after October 31, 1984. Equipment manufactured before that date may  only use live \nbooms when none of the free fall prohibitions outlined in  Sec.  1926.1426(a)(1) are present.      OSHA \nreceived no comments on proposed Sec.  1926.1440(b).  Therefore, in the final rule, this paragraph will \nretain the approach  to live booms described in the proposal. Accordingly, final paragraph  (b) of this section \napplies an approach to live booms used with  sideboom cranes that is similar to the approach discussed above \nfor  Sec.  1926.1426. The only difference is the cut -off date of manufacture  for sideboom cranes with live \nbooms. As explained above in the  discussion of Sec.  1926.1426(a)(2), in light of t he history of the  ANSI \nB30.5 prohibition against live booms, most equipment covered by  this standard manufactured after October \n31, 1984, does not have live  booms. In contrast, the ANSI/ASME standards applicable to sideboom  cranes \n(ANSI/ASME B30.14) ha ve never prohibited live booms. As a  result, sideboom cranes with live booms \ncontinued to be manufactured  after 1984. Consequently, under Sec.  1926.1440(b), to avoid undue  \nburden on employers, OSHA is designating the cut -off date of  manufacture for sideboom cranes with live \nbooms as the effective date  of this final standard. Therefore, employers may continue to use  sideboom \ncranes manufactured prior to this date in which the boom is  designed to free fall, except under the conditions \nspecified in Sec .   1926.1426(a)(1). OSHA determines that these conditions will increase  employee safety \ncompared to current practices. No comments were submitted  on this paragraph; it is promulgated as \nproposed.",

This provision serves several purposes.  First, it prevents platform tipping due to entanglement with \nother load  lines or loads. Second, it reduces the ch ance that the equipment could  be overloaded. Third, \nwhen hoisting personnel, it is essential that the  operator's full attention be devoted to the hoisted personnel; \nuse of  another load line necessarily diverts his/her attention. An exception  applies fo r pile driving \noperations, as the pile driver is always  suspended on a load line and at times personnel have to be hoisted on  \nanother line to conduct work during the pile driving operation.      In the preamble to the proposed rule, \nOSHA explained that the C-DAC  consensus language for this provision would have applied the  requirement \nonly when personnel were suspended on a personnel platform.  However, the standard permits personnel to \nbe hoisted without a  personnel platform under certain circumstances. Since the requirement  also needs to \napply in those circumstances, OSHA expanded the language  so that, in proposed paragraph (k)(11)(i), it also \napplied in those  circumstances (see 73 FR 59836, Oct. 9, 2008). No comments were  received on this issue; \nthe provision is promulgated as proposed.     Paragraph (k)(11)(ii), Other load lines, allows the use of a winch  \nline while hoisting personnel when all of the following factors are  present: the personnel platform is a factory-\nproduced boom-mounted  personnel platform incorporating a winch as original equipment, the  load on the \nwinch line does not exceed 500 pounds, and the load on the  winch line itself does not exceed the rated \ncapacity of the winch and  platform. C-DAC selected these factors based on the experience of its  members, \nand determined that when all of these factors are present,  there is little chance that the use of the winch line \nwill compromise  employee safety. OSHA agrees.     Paragraph (k)(12)(i), Traveling--equipment other than \nderricks,  prohibits any traveling by equipment with hoisted employees except in  two circumstances. The \nfirst is where the equipment is traveling on  fixed rails. The second is where the employer demonstrates that \nthere is no less hazardous way to perform the work than by traveling.  However, this second exception does \nnot apply to rubber -tired  equipment, for which traveling is always prohibited. Traveling with  hoisted \nemployees is also a lways prohibited for derricks, as set forth  under Sec.  1926.1431(k)(13). (See the \ndiscussion of these provisions  in the preamble to the proposed rule, 73 FR at 59836 -59837, Oct. 9,  2008.)     \nNo comments were received on paragraphs (k)(10), (k)(11)(ii) or  (k)(12)(i); they are promulgated as proposed. \nHowever, the note that  appeared at the end of (k)(10) has been added to (k)(10)(i) as  described above.     \nParagraph (k)(12)(ii) (A)-(E), Traveling--equipment other than  derricks, establishes certain criteria that must \nbe met when traveling  with employees in the situations permitted under paragraph (k)(12)(i).      One \ncommenter stated the requirement to limit travel to the boom  length was unclear. (ID -0053.1.) This \ncommenter believed it could be  interpreted to limit the length of the boom itself and not the distance  the \nequipment can travel. The Agency concludes the requirement as  written in the proposed rule, \"Travel shall \nbe limited to boom  length,\" is clear. However, in the interest of providing additional  clarity, the Agency is \nadding the word \"equipment\" to the text of the  final rule so that it will read, \"Equipment travel m ust be \nlimited to  boom length.\" The addition of this word makes it clear the focus of  the requirement is the \ndistance of travel for the equipment.      Paragraph (k)(13), Traveling --derricks, prohibits a derrick from  \ntraveling while it is hoisting person nel. In C -DAC's experience,  hoisting employees on a traveling derrick is \ndangerous because derricks  are not sufficiently stable when traveling. No comment was received on  this \nprovision; it is promulgated as proposed.  Paragraph (l) [Reserved.]",

This binds the system and  continued application of power can cause \nfailure of the hoist rope or  other component.\" As the definition indicates, two-blocking can cause  the crane \nto drop the load, the headache ball, or another component,  creating a hazard to employees be low. When \nhoisting personnel, an anti  two-blocking device had been required by former Sec.   1926.550(g)(3)(ii)(C) \nsince October 3, 1988, but was not otherwise  required under subpart N. OSHA concludes that requiring the \nuse of anti  two-blocking devices will reduce the number of crane-related injuries  and fatalities.     There \nare two forms of anti two-block devices: an automatic  prevention device or a warning device. The automatic \nprevention device  automatically stops two-blocking from occurring. The warning device  warns the operator \nwhen two-blocking is about to occur. OSHA determines  that an automatic prevention device provides better \nprotection than a  warning device for employees, since it automatically stops two - blocking. As discussed \nbelow, the standard ultimately requires  automatic prevention devices on all equipment manufactured after  \nFebruary 28, 1992, under a phase -in schedule. The standard takes into  account of the date the national \nconsensus standard, ASME B30.5, began  to require such devices for telescopic boom cranes, and that B30.5  \ncontinues to allow lattice boom cranes to be equipped with either  automatic prevention devices or warning \ndevices.     ASME B30.5, effective February 28, 1992, states that telescopic  boom cranes must h ave \nautomatic prevention devices. For lattice boom  cranes, ASME B30.5 states that they must have two -block \nprotection but  allows greater flexibility, allowing them to be equipped with either  automatic prevention \ndevices or warning devices. The additional  protection for telescopic boom cranes in the ASME standard \nreflects the  fact that such cranes are more likely to two-block because telescoping  the boom out (an action \nthat does not occur with lattice boom cranes)  moves the boom's block closer to the load end of the hoist \ncable, which  can cause two-blocking.     Because February 28, 1992 is the date that ASME B30.5 first stated  \nthat telescopic boom cranes must have anti two -block devices and is  when the industry first began widely \nmanufacturing or equipping such  cranes with such devices, proposed paragraph (d)(3)(i) requires  automatic \nprevention devices on all telescopic boom cranes manufactured  after February 28, 1992. However, because \nASME B30.5 allows lattice  boom cranes to have either an automatic prevention device or a warning  device \nsince February 28, 1992, paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(A) gives employers  the option of using either device on lattice \nboom cranes manufactured  between February 28, 1992, and one year after the effective date of  this \nstandard.     OSHA concludes that an automatic prevention device provides better  protection than a \nwarning device because i t directly addresses the  hazard, rather than alerting an operator and requiring an \nadditional  step by the operator to address the hazard. Therefore, lattice boom  cranes manufactured more \nthan one year after the effective date of this  standard must be equipped with an automatic prevention device.     \nParagraph (d)(3)(ii)(C) excludes lattice boom equipment used during  certain activities from the anti two-block \nrequirements of (d)(3)(A)  and (B). The provision exempts lattice boom equipment when used for  dragline, \nclamshell (grapple), magnet, drop ball, container  handling,\\81\\ concrete bucket, marine operations that do \nnot involve  hoisting personnel, and pile driving work. C-DAC indicated that most of  these operations involve \nheavy repetitive motion, and anti -two-block  devices used during these activities consistently malfunction \n(that is,  the device \"trips\" even though two-blocking has not occurred) and are  frequently damaged. -------\n--------------------------------------------------------------------      \\81\\ In most situations hoisting containers are \nregulated under  29 CFR part 1918; this standard applies to hoisting contain ers only  where that activity is \nconstruction work. For example, hoisting a  container of construction material from a ship onto a concrete \npier  that is part of a bridge construction project is a construction  activity covered by this standard. ----------",
    "73861199-1206-4f73-9b1e-5ffb04a423a9": "page_label: 317\nfile_name: OSHA-Final Rule-Cleaned.pdf\nfile_path: C:\\Users\\bs44876\\Desktop\\Project\\CII-Crane\\FineEmb\\dataset\\data\\OSHA-Final Rule-Cleaned.pdf\nfile_type: application/pdf\nfile_size: 3496317\ncreation_date: 2025-01-07\nlast_modified_date: 2025-01-07\n\n-both written comment as well as testimony at the public  hearings. The key issue for these ind ustries was \nthat their deliveries  to construction sites were typically not construction work and about  one-half of all \ndeliveries are to the ground. (ID -0341: -0343.) For  deliveries onto or into structures, such as drywall into \nbuildings and  roofing materials up to roofs, they use articulating cranes which have  controls to prevent \ntipover, called lifting moment limiting devices  (LMLD). The Specialty Building Material Distributors and Safety  \nCoalition (SBMDSC) in testimony described truck-mounted cranes used to  deliver drywall, for example, and \n\"knuckle\" cranes used to deliver  roofing materials. The Agency has concluded that these are both  versions \nof articulating cranes. Both SBMDSC and the National Lumber  and Building Material Dealers Association  \nrepeated several times in  written comment and public testimony that their articulating cranes had  LMLDs. \n(ID-0184; -0326.1; -0341; -0344; -0380.1.) Since the truck- mounted cranes in use are articulating cranes with \nLMLDs, they are  exempt from the rule and these industries will not incur any costs of  compliance. Although \nthe industries did not report any older truck - mounted cranes used for deliveries without LMLDs, if these do \nexist,  the employer would have the option to use them for deliveries to the  ground (and be unaffected by \nthe final standard since this is not a  \"construction activity\") or to deliver materials into or onto  structures \nby complying with the rule, which would essentially be to  ensure that their operators are certified, as well as \nfollowing the  final standard's specific safety precautions. In addition, operator  certification is required only \nwithin four years after the standard is  effective, and any older equipment may be replaced in the interim if  \nstill extant.      The Heating and Air Conditioning Equipment Distributors  reported that their deliveries to \nbuildings would be affected by the  final standard because they often must h oist equipment to the first or  \nsecond floor of buildings, which would qualify as construction work.  (ID-0235.1.) Deliveries are also made to \nthe ground, and some employers  do hire crane trucks for some deliveries. The Heating, Air  Conditioning, \nand Refrigeration Distributors International (HARDI)  reported that their 450 members who are wholesale \ndistributors in the  industry have, on average, 11 branch companies each. According the 2006  CPB and SUSB, \nthere are 5,193 establishments with 55,606 employee s, or  about 10 to 11 employees per employer. The \nAgency estimates that the typical  establishment in the industry operates one truck -mounted crane with a \nsingle,  trained operator who must become a certified crane operator under the final  standard to deliver \nHVAC equipment onto structures.      Direct-selling propane dealers use cranes to deliver and  install LP , or \npropane, tanks, mostly in rural areas. Installing a new  tank would constitute a construction activity, and crane \nuse for that  activity would fall under the final crane standard. The affected  industry is identified as NAICS \n434312 Liquefied Petroleum Gas Dealers.  According to the 2006 CPB and SUSB there are 5,567 \nestablishments in  the direct selling sector with 43,583 employees. Clearly, th e industry  is predominantly \nmade up of small businesses, with the average  establishment having about eight employees, and this is \nattested to by  the industry's comment (ID -0198.1). The National Propane Gas  Association noted that \ndelivering tanks is \"one of the most common  activities\" performed by propane retail marketers and that \"to  \ninstall these tanks, it often requires the need of a truck-mounted  crane to lift and/or place the empty ASME \ntank onto its support or  foundation.\" (ID -0198.1.) The Agency estimates that each of the retail  \nestablishments has, on average, a truck-mounted crane that would be  engaged occasionally in construction \nactivity covered under the rule.      Locomotive cranes are listed as one of the types of cranes  covered by \nthe final standard, and several railroads participated in  the rulemaking.

Several states submitted comments on the  \nproposed rule urging the Agency to preserve State and local operator  licensing laws. Some of these concerns \nare addressed in the discussion  of preemption under fed eralism in section V.D of this preamble. Two of  \nthose commenters, each with its own statewide crane operator licensing  requirements, specifically requested \nthat OSHA mandate compliance with  State requirements for crane operations within the jurisdiction  of  \nthose states (with the exception of operators who are employees of the  U.S. military). (ID -0171.1; -0237.) \nThree State governments argued  persuasively that if government licensing was presented merely as an  \noption, rather than required, many employers would simply by -pass these licensing requirements in favor of \nless stringent, portable private  certification options. (ID -0171.1.) One State  government also noted  that \nsome states have proven, reliable licensing procedures already in  place. Where State and local licensing \ndepartments or offices are  already well established and staffed, and are already preventing deaths  or \nserious injuries through the use of effective licensing procedure,  there is little support in the record for \ndisturbing them.     In light of the commenter's compelling arguments and the policy  considerations noted \nabove, the Agency is convinced that the  governmental licensing requirements should be mandatory, rather \nthan  optional. In response, the Agency is revising paragraphs (a) and (e) of  Sec.  1926.1427 to mandate \ncompliance with State and local operator  licensing laws that meet a \"Federal floor\" established in paragraphs  \n(e)(2) and (j) of this section. \\114\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\114\\ This \n\"Federal floor\" refers to the minimum requirements  for license tests in Sec.  1926.1427(e)(2), and the \nminimum  knowledge and skills that must be tested as set forth in Sec.   1926.1427(j)(1) and (j)(2). \nEmployers would not be required by OSHA  to comply with State or local government entity licensing  \nrequirements that do not meet this \"Federal floor,\" but States and  local governments could still seek to \nenforce their own laws.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      This mandatory \ncompliance is set forth in the introductory text of  Sec.  1926.1427(a)(1) and paragraph (a)(1)(i ). OSHA has \nadded Sec.   1926.1427(a)(1)(ii) to clarify that employees of the U.S. military who  have been certified or \nqualified to operate equipment pursuant to Sec.   1926.1427(d) would not also be required to obtain an \noperator's license  from a State or local government for construction work on behalf of the  military employer . \nBy requiring compliance with State and local laws,  the Agency is also complying with Executive Order 13132, \nwhich urges  agencies to preserve the full force and effect to State and local laws.  (See 64 FR 43225, Aug. \n10, 1999.)      This decision is a logical outgrowth of the proposal. The proposal  identified a significant \nsafety risk from impr oper operation of  equipment and proposed certification requirements as a means of  \naddressing that risk. Governmental licensing of crane operators has  existed alongside OSHA's prior crane rules \nat former Sec.  1926.550 for  many years, and C -DAC made them a significant component of the proposal  \nwithout any indication that the new standard would exempt employers  from compliance with those laws. \nThe government licensing provision was  the subject of a number of comments, and was discussed during the  \nhearing in the context of comments requesting OSHA to make the  government licensing mandatory.     The \npreamble to the proposed rule noted C -DAC's opinion that some  States have \"effective, reliable, licensing \nprocedures\" (73 FR 59814,  Oct. 9, 2008). The pre amble to the proposed rule also specifically  cited the \nDepartment of Transportation's requirement that commercial  drivers also carry State drivers licenses issued",

Accordingly, under the  final rule, subpart M does not apply to equipment covered \nby subpart CC  except where Sec.  1926.1423 incorporates requirements of subpart M by  reference.     \nIn this regard, the Agency has amended subpart M at Sec.   1926.500(a)(2)(ii) to make clear that subpart CC \nspecifies the  circumstances in which fall protection must be provided to workers on  equipment covered by \nsubpart CC. The Agency has also amended Sec.   1926.500(a)(3) to state that the criteria for fall protection \nsystems  required under subpart CC are as set forth in Sec.  1926.1423 of  subpart CC. In addition, Sec.  \n1926.500(a)(4) has been amended to  specify that the training requirements in Sec.  1926.503 do not apply  \nto the use of equipment covered by subpart CC. These amendments to  Sec.  1926.500 are discussed in the \nexplanation of amendments to  subpart M. Definition of \"Fall Protection Equipment\"      \"Fall protection \nequipment\" is defined in Sec.  1926.1401, and is  limited to guardrail systems, safety net systems, personal \nfall arrest  systems, positioning device systems, and fall restraint systems. One  commenter stated that this \ndefinition should be changed to that found  in ANSI/ASSE Z359.0--2007, Definitions and Nomenclature used \nfor Fall  Protection and Fall Arrest, which defines \"fall protection\" more  broadly to include any equipment, \ndevice, or system that either  prevents a fall or mitigates the effect of a fall. (ID-0178.1.)  However, as OSHA \nexplained in the proposed rule, the proposed  definition was chosen to use the same terminology found in \nother OSHA  standards to ensure that employers would be familiar with the terminology  (see 73 FR 59799, \nOct. 9, 2008). Moreover, OSHA notes that sec. 1.3.1 of  ANSI/ASSE Z359.0--2007 provides that the scope of \nthat standard does not  include the construction industry. Accordingly, OSHA is retaining the  proposed \ndefinition in the final rule. Definition of \"Positioning Device System\"     A trade association objected to the \nlack of definitions for \"fall  arrest\" or \"positioning systems.\" (ID -0178.1.) OSHA notes that  proposed Sec.  \n1926.1401 did contain a definition for \"personal fall  arrest system,\" and that definition is included in the final \nrule.  OSHA agrees that a definition of \"positioning device system\" is  needed and is adding a definition to \nSec.  1926.1401 in the final rule  that is the same as the definition found in subpart M.  Paragraph (a) \nApplication     Section 1926.1423(a) specifies which provisions in this section  apply to all equipment, \nincluding tower cranes (Sec. Sec.   1926.1423(c)(1), (c)(2), (d), (g), (j) and (k)); which provisions apply  to all \nequipment except tower cranes (Sec. Sec.  1926.1423(b), (c) (3),  (e) and (f)); and which provisions apply only \nto tower cranes  (Sec. Sec.  1926.1423(c)(4) and (h)).  Paragraph (b) Boom Walkways     For the reasons \nexplained in the preamble to the proposed rule,  Sec.  1926.1423( b) addresses the hazard of falls from lattice \nbooms by  establishing when walkways must be incorporated into lattice booms, and  the criteria for such \nwalkways (see 73 FR 59799-59800, Oct. 9, 2008).  No comments were received on this paragraph; it is included \nin the  final rule without change. Paragraph (c) Steps, Handholds, Ladders, Grabrails, Guardrails and  Railings     \nSection 1926.1423(c) in the final rule specifies criteria for the  use and maintenance of steps, handholds, \nladders, grabrails, guardrails  and railings.",

To avoid misunderstanding and establish an objective requirement for  when the boom had \nto be secured, C-DAC proposed that the boom be  secured whenever the derrick is taken out of service for 30 \ndays or  more. No comments were received for paragraph (m); it is promulgated as  proposed. Paragraph (n)     \n\"Jumping the derrick\" is the practice of moving structural  components of the derrick to different locations, \nsuch as to the upper  floors as a building is constructed, and is essential to some  construction activities. \nSection 1926.1436(n) requires that the process  of jumping the derrick be supervised by the A/D \n(assembly/disassembly)  director. As defined in Sec.  1926.1401, the A/D director must either  be a person \nwho meets the criteria for both a competent person and a  qualified person, or a competent person who is \nassisted by one or more  qualified persons.     As discussed above, paragraph (g) of this section requires a  \nderrick to be load tested to confirm that the derrick and its support  can withstand rated loads. C -DAC \ndiscussed whether load testing should  be required when a derrick is jumped, but ultimately concluded that \na  jumped derrick need not be load tested and determined that the A/D  director could be relied upon to see \nthat the jumped derrick is  properly erected and anchored and complies with the applicable  requirements \nof this standard. OSHA is satisfied with C -DAC's rationale  and agrees that giving the A/D director the \nresponsibility for  supervising the jumping of a derrick will ensure that the jumped  derrick is safe to use.      \nSeveral labor representatives objected to the use of the word  \"supervisor\" in the term \"A/D supervisor\" used \nin proposed Sec.   1926.1404(a). (ID -0182.1; -0199.1; -0172.1.) As explained in the  discussion of \nassembly/disassembly, OSHA has decided to replace the  term A/D supervisor with \"A/D director\" in Sec.  \n1926.1404(a).  Accordingly, OSHA has revised this paragraph to replace the term A/D  supervisor with the \nterm A/D director.      A commenter recommended that Sec.  1926.1436(n) be revised to add a  \nrequirement to include a \"site -specific jumping plan approved by a  registered professional engineer.\" (ID-\n0120.1.) However, the commenter  provided no explanation for this recommendation, nor did the commenter  \nprovide any information to establish how this would be an improvement  over the rule's requirement to have \nthe jumping process dir ected by an  A/D director. Since no information supporting this revision was  \npresented, OSHA finds no persuasive reason to modify the provision  based on this comment; it is \npromulgated as proposed. Paragraph (o)     Paragraph (o) of this section requires that derrick operations be  \nsupervised by a competent person. No comments were received for this  provision; it is promulgated as \nproposed. Subpart N incorporated sec.  6.3.1.1 of ANSI B30.6-1969, which requires derrick operations to be  \ndirected by a designated individual. ASME B30.6 -2003 contains a similar  requirement, and both consensus \nstandards specify the requirements and  practices of that designated individual. OSHA concludes, as did C -\nDAC,  that the definition of competent person meets the objectives of the  ANSI/ASME designated individual \nrequirements to competently perform the  specific duties involved in supervising derrick operations. The  \nexperience and knowledge possessed by the competent person and his/her  ability to recognize and correct \npotential hazardous conditions will  help ensure the safety of derrick operations.  Paragraph (p) Inspections     \nUnder paragraph (p) of this section, the inspection requirements of  Sec.  1926.1412 apply to derrick s.

The third method commonly used in construction work is a temporary  guardrail system, \nbut that also would require attaching stanchions to  the boom, which would be infeasible for these same \nreasons.     The Committee concluded that, in light of such factors, it would  not be appropriate to require \nfall protection when an employee moves  point-to-point on horizontal lattice booms. However, in the \npreamble to  the proposed rule, the Agency noted that, although it may rarely be  necessary for an employee \nmoving point-to-point on a horizontal lattice  boom to be 15 feet or more above the next lower level, there is \nthe  possibility of such an occurrence, such as where a horizontal boom  spans a large gap  in the ground \nsurface. At such heights a personal  fall arrest system tied off at the level of the employee's feet would  allow \nsufficient room for the arrest system to operate without allowing  the employee to strike the next lower level. \nTherefore, the Agency  requested public comment on whether proposed Sec.  1926.1423(d)(1)(ii)  \\101\\ \nshould be expanded to require fall protection when an employee,  engaged in non-A/D work, is moving point-\nto-point on a boom that is  horizontal and the fall distance is 15 feet or more. -----------------------------------------\n----------------------------------      \\101\\ Proposed Sec.  1926.1423(d)(1)(ii) corresponds with final  Sec.  \n1926.1423(e)(1)(ii). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      OSHA received three \ncomments on this issue. (ID -0182.1; -0205.1; - 0213.1.) These commenters stated that the final rule should \nrequire  fall protection when an employee, engaged in non-A/D work, is moving  point-to-point on a boom \nthat is horizontal and the fall distance is 15  feet or more. Accordingly, the Agency has added paragraph \n(e)(1)(iii)  to the final rule to require fall protection under these circumstances.  No comments were received \non proposed paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (ii),  and they are included in the final rule without change as paragraphs  \n(e)(1)(i) and (ii). Paragraph (e)(2) Non-Assembly/Disassembly: While at a Work Station     Paragraph (e)(2) of \nthis section requires employers to provide and  ensure the use of fall protection while an employee is at a \nwork  station on any part of the equipment (including the boom, of any type),  except when the employee is \nat or near draw-works (when the equipment  is running), in the cab, or on the deck (see the discussion of this \nin  the preamble of the proposed rule, where this paragraph was denominated  as Sec.  1926.1423(d)(2); \n73 FR 59802, Oct. 9, 2008). No comments were  received on this paragraph; it is included in the final rule \nwithout change  other than its redesignation. Paragraph (f) Assembly/Disassembly     Paragraph (f) of this \nsection requires the employer to provide and  ensure the use of fall protection equipment during as sembly \nand  disassembly (A/D) work for employees who are on a walking/working  surface with an unprotected side \nor edge more than 15 feet above a  lower level, except when the employee is at or near draw -works (when  \nthe equipment is running), in the cab, or on the deck (see the  discussion of this in the preamble of the \nproposed rule, where this  paragraph was denominated as Sec.  1926.1423(e); 73 FR 59802, Oct. 9,  2008). \nNo comments were received on this paragraph; it is included in  the final rule without change other than its \nredesignation.

This  approach consists of two basic \nsteps. First, the employer must identify  the work zone, assess it for power lines, and determine how close the  \ncrane could get to them. The employer has the option of doing this  assessment for the area 360 degrees \naround the crane or for a more  limited, demarcated area. Second, if the assessment shows that the  crane \ncould get closer than a trigger distance--20 feet for lines rated  up to 350 kV--then requirements for additional \naction are triggered.     Specifically, unless the power lines are deenergized and grounded,  encroachment \nprevention measures have to be implemented to prevent the  crane from breaching a minimum clearance \ndistance. The employer is  allowed to choose among three minimum clearance distance options. For  \nexample, for lines up to 350 kV, the minimum clearance distance options  are 20 feet, or the distance specified \nin Table A of this section for  the line's voltage (Table A is the \"10-foot rule\"; see discussion of  Table A below), \nor a distance closer than what is specified in Table A.  However, there are limitations to the availability of some \nof these  options, and the number of mandatory encroachment prevention (and  other) measures increases \nwhen using a clearance distance closer than  Table A. Paragraph (a) Hazard Assessments and Precautions \nInside the Work Zone     Before beginning crane/derrick operations, the employer is required  to determine \nif power lines would pose a hazard. The first step in this  process is to identify the work zone for which this \nhazard assessment  will be made (Sec.  1926.1408(a)(1)). The empl oyer has two options for  defining the \nwork zone.     Under the first option (Sec.  1926.1408(a)(1)(i)), the employer is  required to define the \nwork zone by marking boundaries and prohibiting  the operator from operating the equipment past those \nboundaries.  Examples of how to demarcate the boundaries include using flags or  devices such as a range \nlimit device or range control warning device.  \"Range control warning device\" is defined in Sec.  1926.1401 \nas \"a  device that can be set by an equipment operator to warn that the boom  or jib tip is at a plane or \nmultiple planes.\"     OSHA noted in the proposed rule that the term \"range limit  device\" was used in \nproposed Sec.  1926.1408(a)(1)(i) but that no  definition of this term was provided in proposed Sec.  \n1926.1401. OSHA  stated that it determined that C-DAC understood a range limit device to  be a device that \nphysically limits how far a crane can boom out and the  angle within which the boom can swing. OSHA \nrequested public comment on  whether a definition of \"range limit device\" should be added to Sec.   \n1926.1401 and, if so, whether the definition described in the proposed  rule preamble is appropriate (73 FR \n59759, Oct. 9, 2008).     Three commenters responded, endorsing the need for a definition and  suggesting \nlanguage along the lines discussed in the proposed rule.  (ID-0118; -0205.1; -0213.1.) OSHA has added a \ndefinition for a \"range  control limit device\" that defines it as \"a device that can be set by  an equipment \noperator to limit movement of the boom or jib tip to a  plane or multiple planes.\"      Employers are not \npermitted to use existing landmarks to demarcate  work zone boundaries unless they are marked. For example, \na line of  trees would be insufficient. Without anything more the trees would not  signal a reminder to the \noperator of there being a boundary that must  be maintained. However, adding flags to those trees would be \nsufficient  because the flags would serve as a reminder that the trees are located  along a boundary that the \noperator must not breach.     The boundaries must mark the limits of all crane movement. For  example, a \nwork zone could be defined by demarcating boundaries: (1) To  the left and right of the operator, to limit the \nlateral movement of  the boom, and (2) in front of the operator, in a line connecting the  side boundaries, \nlimiting the boom's radius.",

Regarding the  first option, the anti two-\nblock device used must meet the require ments  for such devices specified by Sec.  1926.1416(d)(3). \nParagraph (d)(3)  of Sec.  1926,1416 addresses two types of anti two -block devices: the  warning type, and \nthe automatic-prevention type (see the discussion of  these devices above under Sec.  1926.1416(d)(3) of \nthis preamble). The  type required depends on the type of crane and the date of manufacture.  However, Sec.  \n1926.1416(d)(3) requires that employers use the  automatic-prevention type on equipment manufactured \nmore than one year  after the effective date of this final standard. Therefore, since the  requirement in Sec.  \n1926.1441(d)(2) only applies to equipment  manufactured more than one year after the effective date of this \nfinal  standard, and to remain consistent with Sec.  1926.1416(d)(3), the anti  two-block device used on \nequipment covered by this section must be the  automatic-prevention type. The Committee concluded that it \nwould be  inappropriate to apply this requirement to equipment manufactured  before either a voluntary \nconsensus standard or Federal requirement is  in place. Therefore, this paragraph applies to equipment \nmanufactured  more than one year after the effective d ate of this final standard.      OSHA received no \ncomments on any provision of proposed paragraph  (c). Based on the Committee's rationale for these \nprovisions, and the  increased safety afforded to employees, OSHA is adopting these  provisions in the final \nrule as proposed.     Paragraph (e) of this section requires that, before operating  equipment, employers \ntrain operators on the safe operation of the type  of equipment the operator will be using. OSHA received two \ncomments on  the proposed paragraph. The first commenter believed the 2,000 pound  cut-off was too low \nand, because the operators would not have to be  certified, employers will use lower -capacity cranes to \nperform  construction jobs that require higher -capacity equipment. (ID -0189.)  The secon d commenter \nstated that certification of the operators of low- capacity cranes is unnecessary in the home-building industry, \nbut  offered no rationale for this position. (ID -0232.)     OSHA notes that the problem of overloading \nequipment would exist  even at a higher cut-off point. The only way to eliminate this problem  would be to \nrequire operator qualification/certification pursuant to  Sec.  1926.1427 for all equipment, including  \nequipment covered by this  section. The Committee concluded that it is appropriate to exempt  lower-\ncapacity equipment from the operator qualification/certification  requirements of Sec.  1926.1427. \nConsistent with the Committee's  consensus, OSHA finds that training operators in the safe operation of  the \nequipment as required by this final standard reduces the likelihood  of accidents and injuries by minimizing \noperator error; therefore, the  operator certification/qualification procedures required for h igher- capacity \nequipment under Sec.  1926.1427 are not necessary for this  lower-capacity equipment.      Under \nparagraph (f) of this section, employers must ensure that  signal persons are trained in the proper use of \nsignals applicable to  the use of equipment covered by this section. Although the equipment  covered by this \nsection has a low capacity, in some circumstances its  safe operation depends on signals given by a signal \nperson.  Accordingly, this paragraph ensures that communication between the  crane operator and the signal \nperson is clear and effective. However,  the Committee concluded that the comprehensive signal -person  \nqualification procedures required for higher -capacity equipment under  Sec.  1926.1428, Signal person \nqualifications, are not needed for this  equipment. OSHA received no comments on proposed paragraph (f) \nand is  including the provision in the final rule as proposed based on the  rationale provided by the \nCommittee.     Proposed paragraph (g) of this section required that equ ipment  covered by this section \ncomply with Sec.  1926.1425, Keeping clear of  the load, except for Sec.  1926.1425(c)(3); Sec.  \n1926.1425(c)(3)  specifies that materials be rigged by a qualified rigger. The Committee  determined that, in",

As explained in the proposed \nrule, C-DAC  agreed to the exclusion in proposed paragraph (c)(14) because its  Cranes on Barges Work Group \nconcluded that the requirements of this  rule could not readily be applied to the specialized equipment listed  \nin the exclusion. That rationale favors the broader exclusion  recommended by the commenters.      \nProposed paragraph (c)(15) excluded roustabouts because C-DAC  concluded that the proposed standard was \nsimilarly unsuited to address  these devices (see 73 FR 59731, Oct. 9, 2008). No commenters addressed  this \nissue, and paragraph (c)(15) is promulgated as proposed.      Paragraph (c)(16) excludes helicopter cranes. \nSuch cranes are  regulated under Sec.  1926.551 of subpart N, which is not affected by  this final rule and \ncontinues in effect. C-DAC and OSHA did not intend  to cover helicopter cranes under this subpart. However, \nsuch cranes fit  the description in Sec.  1926.1400(a) of the equipment covered by this  rule in that they are \npower-operated equipment that can hoist, lower,  and horizontally move a suspended load. To avoid any \nuncertainty over  whether they are subject to this rule or to Sec.  1926.551, OSHA  is  explicitly excluding \nthem from this rule through paragraph (c)(16).  Paragraph (c)(17) Delivery of Material to Construction Sites      \nIt is common for material that is to be used in construction work  to be delivered to the construction site on a \ntruck equipped with a  lifting attachment that is used either to place the materials on the  ground or to place \nthem on the structure. For example, articulating/ knuckle-boom truck cranes are often used to deliver bundles \nof drywall  to the site and then move t he bundles from the truck up to a floor of  the building under \nconstruction. To the extent these cranes are used in  \"construction work,\" they fall within the scope of this \nfinal rule as  defined in Sec.  1926.1400(a).      OSHA has long taken the view that an employer who \ndelivers  materials to a construction site is not engaged in \"construction  work\" if that employer's work once \nat the site is limited to simply  placing/stacking the materials on the ground. OSHA requested comment  from \nthe public on whether the final rule should include an explicit  exclusion to this effect (see 73 FR 59731, Oct. \n9, 2008).     Most commenters on this issue favored such an exclusion to clarify  that such equipment was \nnot being used in c onstruction. (ID-0145.1; - 0147.1; -0165.1; -0184.1; -0206.1; -0218.1; -0232.1; -0233.1; -\n0235.1;  -0299.1.) Certain commenters expressed the view that any such exclusion  should also extend to \ndelivery of materials onto structures at the  construction site because, in their view, this was also not a  \nconstruction activity. (E.g., ID -0184.1; -0233.1; -0235.1.) Some of  these commenters represented employers \nwho deliver building materials  such as lumber, drywall, and roofing materials. (See, e.g., ID-0184.1;  -0233.1.) \nOthers represented employers in the heating, ventilation, air  conditioning, and refrigeration (HVACR) industry. \n(ID-0165.1; -0235.1.)  Several of the commenters pointed to the operator training and/or  certification \nrequirements in Sec.  192 6.1427 of the proposed rule as  particularly burdensome given the distinctions \nbetween delivery  activities and what they characterized as the more complex activities  typically associated \nwith the equipment covered by the proposed rule.  (ID-0165.1; -0184.1; -0218.1; -0231.1; -0233.1; -0235.1.)     \nOSHA notes some commenter confusion regarding instances when the  construction materials are not \ndelivered to the curb or a stockyard but  instead to a designated area on the construction site where the  \nmaterials are staged/organized to facilitate hoisting activities.",

In the 24-year period from 1979  through 2002, there were \n51 crane and rigging fatalities, or slightly  more than two per year. For this period, crane and rigging fatalities  \nequaled 9.6% of all Ontario construction fatalities. In the 12 -year  period from 1991 through 2002, the total \nnumber of crane and rigging  fatalities was 9, or fewer than one per year. During this period, crane  and \nrigging fatalities amounted to 4.1% of total construction  fatalities. This study supports C -DAC's conclusion \nthat third-party  certification is an effective means of promoting safe crane  operations.\\107\\ ------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------      \\107\\ The Ontario system requires prospective or current \ncrane  operators (referred to in Ontario as \"hoisting engineers\") to  either successfully complete an",

Second, members were of the view \nthat there is often more  than one way to safely assemble and disassemble a crane, and that it is  \nunnecessary to mandate that in every case the manufacturer procedures  be used. The inclusion of specific \nrequirements in the standard that  employer procedures must meet (see Sec.  1926.1406) addresses the  \nconcern that those procedures ensure worker safety.      Another commenter suggested that employer \nprocedures not be allowed  for climbing operations unless approved b y the manufacturer. (ID- 0137.1.) As \nexplained in the discussion below regarding Sec.   1926.1404(r), the Agency has decided to require \nmanufacturer procedures  to be used with regard to the use of synthetic slings. Since the  commenter has \nnot provided information substantiating the need for  manufacturer approval with respect to deviation from \nclimbing  procedures, the Agency is unaware of any basis to conclude that the  requirements in Sec. Sec.  \n1926.1403 and 1926.1406 would be inadequate  to ensure the safety of employer procedures in this regard.",

OSHA declines to adopt this suggestion because it agrees with  C-DAC's \ndetermination that these devices must be working properly for  the crane to operate safely, and they therefore \nneed to be listed as  safety devices under the standard. Moreover, the commenters who said  these devices \ncannot be checked every shift did not explain why they  believed this was so, and C-DAC's inclusion of them \nas safety devices  shows that C-DAC determined that checking these devices for proper  operation, as Sec.  \n1926.1412(d)(1)(xiv) requires, is feasible. \\133\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \n\\133\\ The three commenters included one C-DAC member and two  organizations that nominated members \nwho served on C -DAC. As  discussed above, OSHA gives reduces weight to comments offered by C - DAC \nmembers and organizations that nominated C -DAC members when  those comments oppose the position \nthose members took in C -DAC  deliberations. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \nOperational aids: Like Sec.  1926.1416 for other equipment, Sec.   1926.1435(e) divides operational aids for \ntower cranes into Category I  aids and Category II aids, with the two categories differing in the  amount of \ntime that temporary alternative measures can be used until  the aids are repaired. For Category I aids that \nperiod is seven days,  and for Category II it is 30 days. Also like Sec.  1926.1416, if a  required part is ordered \nwithin seven days of the occurrence of the  deficiency and not received in time to complete the repair in seven \nand  thirty days, respectively, the employer would have seven days from  receiving the part to complete the \nrepair. The rationale for these time  periods is discussed under Sec .  1926.1416. For purposes of  \nclarification, the Agency has added a reference to Sec.   1926.1435(e)(3) noting that the requirements of Sec.  \n1926.1417(j) are  applicable. See further discussion at Sec.  1926.1417(j).      Section 1926.1435(e)(4) \nspecifies that operational aids must work  properly during operations and, if an aid stops working, the \noperator  is required to safely stop operations until the aid is working properly  again or until the temporary \nalternative measures specified in this  section are implemented. Where a replacement part for an operational  \naid is not available, the substitution of a device that performs the  same function would not be considered a \nmodification subject to Sec.   1926.1434, i.e., it would not need to be approved by t he manufacturer  or a \nregistered professional engineer. (See the discussion above  regarding Sec.  1926.1416 for an explanation of \nthe Committee's  rationale for this approach to operational aids.)     Three of the operational aids discussed \nbelow are required on tower  cranes manufactured more than one year after the effective date of the  \nstandard. The remainder are required on all cranes. It was C -DAC's  understanding that the three aids not \nrequired on existing cranes  represent technology only recently available to the industry, while the  aids that \nare required on all cranes have routinely been used in the  industry for some time.      Paragraph (e)(5) \nrequires the Category I operational aids discussed  below and specifies the alternative measures that would \nhave to be  followed if they are not working properly. If these operational aids  are not working properly, \nthey must be repaired no later than 7 days  after the deficiency occurs. However, if the employer documents \nthat it  has ordered the necessary parts within 7 days of the occurrence of the  deficiency, the repair must \nbe completed within 7 days of receipt of  the parts.     OSHA noted in the proposed rule preamble that the \nterm \"days\"  could mean either business days or calendar days. For the reasons  outlined in the discussion \nof Sec.  1926.1416 above, in the final rule  OSHA has changed \"days\" to \"calendar days\" to reflect the  \nCommittee's intent.      Paragraph (e)(5)(i) requires trolley travel limiting devices.",

The commenter suggested that rental \ncompanies would not accept a  controlling entity's ground conditions unless the controlling entity  purchases \nservices from the rental company to improve them. (ID- 0105.1.)     OSHA determines that the commenter's \nconcerns are unwarranted.  Section 1926.1402(e) is a mechanism for a controlling entity to obtain  \ninformation to facilitate its compliance with Sec.  1926.1402(c)(1).  Once ground conditions meet the criteria \nin Sec.  1926.1402(b), the  controlling entity is not required to make further improvements, even  if the \nrental company objects.     For the reasons above, OSHA is promulgating Sec.  1926.1402(e) as  proposed, \nwith the substitution of the word \"director\" for the word  \"supervisor\" to be consistent with the change made \nand discussed in  Sec.  1926.1404.

After measuring the  thickness \nof the steel and the I -beam's other dimensions, the operator  uses an industry table that shows weight per \nlinear foot for a beam of  these dimensions. The operator then calculates the beam's weight using  that \ninformation. In the proposed rule calculations would be based on a  \"reliable source.\" To avoid the potentially \nsubjective  interpretations of \"reliable,\" OSHA is instead requiring in the final   rule that the calculations be \nbased on a source typically relied on in  the industry.

(ID -0120.0.)     A live video system that provides a full view to the crane  \noperator--i.e., provides a sufficiently broad, clear and detailed view  to enable the operator to see all that is \nneeded to operate the  equipment safely--would meet the \"full view of the operator\"  requirement. Mirrors, \non the other hand, typically distort images or  distances and thus would not normally be sufficient to provide \na \"full  view.\"     The sufficiency of any system will depend on the particular needs   posed by each \nsituation. For this reason, OSHA has decided to rely on  C-DAC's clear and succinct phrase, \"full view of the \noperator,\"  rather than to attempt to further define that concept or to list  acceptable devices in the \nregulatory text.  Paragraph (b) Types of Signals      As explained in the proposed rule preamble, under \nparagraph (b) of  this section, signals to crane operators would have to be by hand,  voice, audible, or \"new\" \nsignals (see 73 FR 59796 -59797, Oct. 9,  2008). As used in this standard, these terms refer to the type of  \nsignal, not the means by which the signal is transmitted.

The commenter stated that C -DAC  agreed to the four -year period when it issued its report in \n2004 to  allow sufficient time for additional certification services to become  available. It noted that several \nadditional testing organizations had  become accredited since 2004 to meet the demand for certification \nunder  various State laws and suggested that the number of accredited testing  organizations was now \nsufficient to meet the demand under this rule  within two years. Another commenter also suggested that the \nphase-in  period could be reduced to two or three years if sufficient certifying  organizations are available \nwhen the final ru le is issued. (ID -0104.1.)     OSHA concludes that the rulemaking record supports the \nproposed  four-year phase-in period. While the availability of certification  services has increased since C -\nDAC issued its report, four years is a  reasonable amount of time to ensure that the supply of certification  \nservices will be sufficient to meet demand. It will also provide time  for those operators who need additional \ntraining to pass qualification/  certification tests to complete that training, and for accredite d  testing \norganizations to develop tests in languages other than English  to accommodate crane operators for whom \nEnglish is not their first  language.     The four year period will also provide time for the market to also  \nrespond to demand for certifica tion programs for certified auditors as  described under Option (2) of this \nsection (and for employers who so  choose to develop audited programs for use under Option (2)). Some  \nState and local government entities now offer licenses and, if those  licensing organizations do not already \nmeet the criteria under Option  (4) of this section, the four-year phase-in period gives them time to  do so if \nthey so choose. C-DAC's determination that four years is a  reasonable phase-in period was not based solely \non the availability of  testing services under Option (1) of this section, and OSHA continues  to agree that \nperiod is appropriate.     Under paragraph (k)(1), during this four year period, Sec. Sec.   1926.1427(k)(1)(i) \nand (ii) address the qualifications and training an  operator must have before becoming qualified or certified \nunder one of  the four options. Section 1926.1427(k)(1)(i) requires that operators be  competent for the \npurposes of operating the equipment safely. This  means that the operator must have the requisite knowledge \nand skill to  identify, anticipate, and avoid actions which could result in hazardous  conditions related to the \nequipment and job site.     Paragraph (k)(1)(ii) requires that employers ensure that operators  who do not \nalready have sufficient knowledge or skill to operate the  equipment safely undergo training prior to engaging \nin operations. In  addition, the employer is required to ensure that the operator is  evaluated to confirm that \nhe/she understands the information provided  in the training.     The interim measures in paragraph (k)(1) \nare not significantly  different from requirements that were effective under subpart N of this  part at former \nSec.  1926.550, Sec.  1926.20(b)(4) (\"the employer  shall permit only those employees qualified by training \nor experience  to operate equipment and machinery\"), and Sec.  1926.21(b)(2)(\"the  employer shall \ninstruct each employee in the r ecognition and avoidance  of unsafe conditions . . .\"). However, they are \nincluded in this final  rule to ensure that there will not be a gap with respect to operator  qualifications \nbetween the termination of the requirements under  subpart N of this part at former Sec.  1926.550 and the \neffective date  of Sec. Sec.  1926.1427(a) through (j) and (m).  Paragraph (l) [Reserved.] Definitions     The \nproposed rule contained definitions of \"portable\" and \"not  portable\" in proposed Sec.  1926.1427(m). In \naddition, OSHA stated  that it was considering adding a definition of \"employee of the U.S.  military\" to \nparagraph (m). As noted above, OSHA has moved the  definitions of \"portable\" and \"not portable\" to the \nprovisions  where those terms are used, and has added a definition of \"employee of  the U.S. military\" to \nparagraph (d). As a result, proposed paragraph  (m) is not needed and is removed.",

Section 1926.1425 Keeping Clear of the Load      This section addresses the hazards \nposed to employees from being  struck or crushed by the load. (See the preamble to the proposed rule  for \na full discussion of C-DAC's rationale for the provisions in this  section (73 FR at 59805-59806, Oct. 9, 2008).) \nParagraph (a)     Paragraph (a) of this section requires the employer to use  available hoisting routes that \nminimize employee exposure to hoisted  loads to the extent consistent with public safety. No comments were  \nreceived on this provision; it is promulgated as proposed.  Paragraph (b)     Paragraph (b) of this section \nspecifies that employees cannot be in  the fall zone when the equipment operator is not moving a suspended  \nload, with limited exceptions as described in paragraphs (b)(1)-(3).     Fall zone is defined in Sec.  1926.1401 \nas \"the area (including  but not limited to the area directly beneath the load) in which it is  reasonably \nforeseeable that partially or completely suspended materials  could fall in the event of an accident.\" The fall \nzone thus includes  both the area directly under the load as well as other areas into which  it is reasonably \nforeseeable that suspended materials could fall. For  example, if wind is causing the load to swing, the \nemployer would need  to consider the extent to which the load is swinging or may swing in  determining the \nextent of the fall zone. Another example is w here a  bundle of materials is suspended, and some loose \nmaterials at the top  of the bundle may slide off sideways. In such a case those materials  would foreseeably \nfall outside the area directly beneath the load.     Paragraph (b)(1) permits employees engaged in hooking, \nunhooking or  guiding a load to be within the fall zone while engaged in these  activities. No comments were \nreceived on this paragraph; it is  promulgated as proposed.     Paragraph (b)(2) permits employees engaged \nin the initial  attachment of the load to a component or structure to be within the  fall zone. One example of \nthis activity is: A subassembly of steel  members is hoisted for attachment to a structure. When initially  \nattaching the lower portion of that subassembly, an employ ee is within  the fall zone of the load. In this \nexample, the employee engaged in the  initial attachment of the subassembly to the structure would be  \npermitted to be within the fall zone; that work cannot be done  otherwise. No comments were received on \nthis paragraph; it is  promulgated as proposed.     Paragraph (b)(3) allows workers to be present in the fall \nzone when  operating a concrete hopper or concrete bucket. The employee operating  the hopper or bucket \nis necessarily in the fall zone since the hopper or  bucket is suspended while the employee operates the \nreleasing mechanism.     One commenter suggested adding a requirement that there be a  competent \nsupervisor for these operations and a requirement for  employee training for activities covered by paragraph \n(b)(3). (ID- 0120.1.) However, that commenter did not provide an explanation of how  this would increase \nsafety for the employee or any support for such  additional requirements. Nor did the commenter identify any \nreason why  the activities covered by paragraph (b)(3) would require different or  additional supervision or \ntraining requirements than the activities  covered by paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2). C -DAC did not recommend \nany  additional supervision or training requirements for paragraph (b)(3),  and OSHA is not persuaded that \nthere is a safety justification for  deviating from C -DAC's determination. Therefor e, this paragraph is  \npromulgated as proposed.     A representative of the building industry suggested in its comment  that an \nexception should be added for dedicated spotters and fall  monitors. (ID-0232.1.) This marks a change from \nthe position of that  organization's nominated representative during the negotiated  rulemaking. (See \ndiscussion of this organization's comments under  paragraph (c) of this section.) C-DAC did not conclude that \nan  exception for spotters and fall monitors was warranted, and th e NAHB  did not present evidence to \npersuade OSHA otherwise.",

Section 1926.1416, Operational aids,  contains provisions to protect against \ntwo-blocking.     8. July 13, 1999: Three fatalities. Three employees were in a  personnel basket 280 feet \nabove the ground. They were in the process of  guiding a large roof section, being lifted by another crane, into  \nplace. Winds gusting to 27 miles per hour overloaded the crane holding  the roof section; that crane collapsed, \nstriking the crane that was  supporting the personnel basket, causing the boom to fall. All three  employees \nreceived fatal crushing injuries. (ID-0018.)     This type of accident will be prevented by Sec.  1926.1417(n),  \nwhich requires the competent person in charge of the operation adjust  the equipment and/or operations to \naddress the effect of wind and other  adverse weather conditions on the equipment's  stability and rated  \ncapacity. In addition, Sec.  1926.1431, Hoisting personnel, requires  that, when wind speed (sustained or gust) \nexceeds 20 mph, employers  must not hoist employees by crane unless a qualified person determines  it is \nsafe to do so.      9. November 7, 2005: One fatality. A construction worker was  crushed between the \noutrigger and the rotating superstructure of a  truck crane. The worker apparently was trying to retrieve a \nlevel and a  set of blueprints located horizontal member of one of the outriggers  when the operator began \nto swing the boom. (ID-0017.5.)     Section 1926.1424, Work area control, will prevent this type of  accident. \nThis section generally requires that employers erect barriers  to mark the area covered by the rotating \nsuperstructure to warn workers  of the danger zone. However, workers who must work near equipment with  \na rotating superstructure must be trained in the hazards involved. If a  worker must enter a marked area, the \ncrane operator must be notified of  the entry, and must not rotate the superstructure until the area is  clear.     \n10. March 19, 2005: Two fatalities and one injury. During steel - erection operations, a crane was lifting three \nsteel beams to a parking  garage. The crane tipped over and the boom collapsed. The boom and  attached \nbeams struck concrete workers next to the structure, killing  two workers and injuring one worker. The \naccident apparently occurred  because the crane was overloaded. (ID-0017.6.)     Overloading a crane can \ncause it to tip over, causing the load or  crane structure to strike and fatally injure workers in the vicinity of  \nthe crane. Section 1926.1417, Operations, includes provisions to  prevent overloading. This section prohibits \nemployers from operating  equipment in excess of its rated capacity, and includes procedures for  ensuring \nthat the weight of the load is reliably determined and within  the equipment's r ated capacity.     The \nprovisions of the final standard addressing operator training,  certification, and qualification (Sec.  \n1926.1427) will also prevent  this type of accident by ensuring that operators recognize conditions  that \nwould overload the cran e.     11. December 7, 2005. One fatality. Two cranes were used to lower a  \nconcrete beam across a river. During the lowering process, one end of  the beam dropped below the other \nend, causing the load's weight to  shift to the lower end; this shift in weight overloaded the crane  lifting the \nlower end, and it tipped over . The lower end of the beam  fell into the river, while the higher end landed on a \nsupport mat  located on the bank of the river, causing a flagger to be thrown into  the beam. (ID -0017.7.)     \nSection 1926.1432, Multiple crane/derrick lifts --supplemental  requirements, will prevent this type of \naccident. This section  specifies that, when more than one crane is supporting a load, the  operation must \nbe performed in accordance with a plan developed by a  qualified person.",

OSHA agrees with the commenters that \nit is necessary to address  stabilizers in Sec.  1926.1404(q). With  the exception of Sec.   1926.1404(q)(2), \nthe term \"stabilizers\" has been added so that each  provision also applies to stabilizers. Section \n1926.1404(q)(2) does not  apply to stabilizers because they are not designed to remove all weight  from the \nvehicle's wheels.     One comment was received in regards to Sec.  1926.1404(q)(4). Under  that provision, \neach outrigger must be visible to the operator or to a  signal person during extension and setting. The \ncommenter suggested  that the requirement be modified so that it would also apply to the  retraction of \noutriggers. (ID-0053.1.) The commenter indicated that  employees can be subject to crushing and pinching \nhazards during  outrigger retraction and this would be less likely to occur if it the  outrigger had to be visible \nto the operator or signal person during  retraction.     OSHA agrees that crushing and pinching hazards exist \nduring  outrigger retraction. However, Sec.  1926.1404(q) is designed to  prevent the overturning o f the \ncrane; it does not address the crushing  and pinching hazards posed by operation of the equipment in struck-\nby  or crushed/by locations outside the operator's view.

This \nwarning line or  barricade must be in view of the operator either directly or by use of  video equipment and \nmust be equipped with flags or similar high - visibility markings. The need for an elevated warning line or \nbarricade  is explained above in the discussion of Sec.  1926.1408(b)( 3). This  provision does not apply to \nsubpart V work.     As discussed above in relation to Sec.  1926.1408(b)(3), there may  be situations where \nthe operator is not able to see an elevated warning line  or barricade. To address such situations, under Sec. \nSec.  1926.1408 and 1926.1409,  OSHA changed the regulatory text so that the employer is required to use \nboth a  dedicated spotter and one of the other (non -spotter) measures listed in  Sec.  1926.1408(b)(4). \nBecause the clearance distances are likely to be  significantly smaller than the Table A distances, the Agency",

The Committee determined, and OSHA agrees, that this  exception is needed because, in those \nsituations, it may be  advantageous to share a single dedicated channel. For example, in some  situations \nseveral cranes may be operating in an area in which their  booms, loads or load lines could come in contact \nwith each other. In  such cases it is crucial that the movements of each crane be properly  coordinated. By \nsharing a single channel, each operator can hear what  each crane is being asked to do, which can facilitate \nthat  coordination.     Several commenters representing the railroad industry raised  concerns about the \ndedicated channel requirement as it relates to the  use of cranes on or adjacent to railroad tracks. (ID-0170.1; \n-0176.1; - 0291.1.) These commenters pointed out that the actions of crane  operators often have to be \ncoordinated with other moving equipment  (e.g. trains) and that the use of a dedicated channel in these  \ncircumstances would actually be more dangerous.     The commenters' points in this regard are persuasive; \nOSHA has  accordingly added Sec.  1926.1420(b)(2). This allows an exception to  the use of a dedicated \nchannel when a crane is being operated on or  near railroad tracks and the crane operator must coordinate \nwith the  movement of other equipment on or near the railroad tracks.      Paragraph (c) of this section \nrequires that the operator's  reception be by a hands -free system. In other words, the operator must  not \nhave to depress a button, manipulate a switch, or take any action  for the incoming signal to be received. C-\nDAC determined that this  provision is needed because the operator must have both hands free to  \nmanipulate the equipment's controls. No comments were received on this  provision; it is included in the final \nrule without change.  Section 1926.1421 Signals --Voice Signals --Additional Requirements      C-DAC \nconsidered whether the rule should include a standardized set  of voice signals. Unlike hand signals, which \nhave become standardized  to a large extent within the industry, in the Committee members'  experience \nthere is significant variation in the phrases used to convey  the same instructions. Consequently, C-DAC was \nconcerned that words or  phrases that it might have chosen to be \"sta ndard\" voice signals  could be \nunfamiliar to many employees in the industry or contrary to  common usage in some parts of the country. In \nlight of this, the  Committee determined that it would be better to use a different  approach to address the \nproblem o f miscommunication when using voice  signals. This approach, which establishes criteria for \nwhatever voice  signals are used, is set out in Sec. Sec.  1926.1421(a) -(c).     Under paragraph (a) of this \nsection, prior to beginning operations,  the personnel involved with signals--the crane operator, signal person  \nand lift director (if there is one) --are required to meet and agree on the  voice signals that will be used. \nBecause of the lack of standardization and  the variety of languages that are in use in the construction industry, \nthe  Committee concluded that it is essential that the persons who give and/or receive  voice signals agree \nin advance on the signals that will be used to avoid  miscommunication. OSHA agrees. Once the parties have \nmet and agreed on the  voice signals, another meeting is not required to discuss them unless another  \nworker is added or substituted, there is some confusion about the signals, or  a signal needs to be changed.     \nSection 192 6.1421(b) requires that each voice signal contain the  following three elements, given in the \nfollowing order: function (such  as hoist, boom, etc.), direction; distance and/or speed; function, stop  \ncommand. For example: hoist up; 10 feet; hoist stop. As discussed  above, the Committee considered it \nimpractical to attempt to  standardize the voice signals themselves (that is, to require the use  of particular \nwords to represent particular functions, directions or  other instructions). However, the Committee concluded \nthat the chance  of miscommunication could nonetheless be reduced if certain parameters  were established \nfor the type of information and order of information  that would be given. OSHA agrees.      Section \n1926.1421(c) requires the crane operat or, signal person,  and lift director (if there is one) to be able to",

OSHA requested public comment on the issue.      Comments were \nreceived from two parties, both of whom nominated C- DAC members. (ID-0205.1; -0213.1.) They stated that \nthe omission was  intentional, believing that C-DAC did not include design factor  criteria for standard wire \nrope because technology is continually  evolving and including design criteria in the rule may hamper future  \ncrane operations. The commenters stated that the proposed rule had  provisions requiring end users to \nconform with requirements or criteria  established by the wire rope manufacturer, equipment manufacturer, \nor a  qualified person.     OSHA notes that C -DAC determined it was im portant for this rule to  allow \nflexibility to accommodate future technological changes. The  commenters on this issue reiterated that \ndetermination, and OSHA shares  that concern. Setting unduly restrictive specifications based on  current \ntechnology could unnecessarily impinge on the use of future  designs. The Agency also concludes, however, \nthat some form of minimum  criteria is necessary so that those selecting wire rope have a minimum  \nbenchmark available as a reference point.     To meet both of these objectives, the Agency has decided, in \nthe  final rule, to add a new paragraph (b) to Sec.  1926.1414 to provide  employers with two options with \nregards to wire rope design criteria.  The first option would be to comply with an industry consensus standard  \n(sec. 5-1.7.1 of ASME B30.5-2004) on design factors for standard wire  rope. See Sec.  1926.1414(b)(1). This \nis a well -established benchmark  for standard wire rope design factors, and the Agency therefore  \ndetermined that it is appropriate to include it as an option. Paragraph  (c) of sec. 5-1.7.1 is excluded because \nthat deals with rotation  resistant rope, which is addressed in Sec.  1926.141 4(e).     The second option \nprovides a performance benchmark that is based on  the rope's compatibility with the rated capacity of the \nequipment and  on the need to be able to rely on the inspections in Sec.  1926.1413 as  an effective means \nof ensuring th e continued safety of the rope. See  Sec.  1926.1414(b)(2). Specifically, the design must be \nsufficient to  ensure that, when the equipment is used in accordance with its rated  capacity, the employer \nwill be able to prevent a sudden failure of the  rope b y meeting the inspection requirements in Sec.  \n1926.1413.     This concept reflects the underlying premise of Sec.  1926.1413  that regular inspection of \nthe rope can prevent catastrophic failure  because the rope's degradation will take place over time and will be  \naccompanied by indications of wear. Therefore, if the rope is  appropriate for the equipment, the degradation \nthat occurs with use  will be sufficiently gradual so that its development can be identified  in the required \ninspections and the rope can be removed from service  before safety is compromised. Paragraph (c)     The \nbenchmarks in the two options in paragraph (b) of this section  do not address an additional design issue, \nwhich is the suitability of  the wire rope with respect to the prope r functioning of the equipment.  For \nexample, selecting a rope with a diameter that is too large for a  particular machine can result in the rope \njumping a sheave. Such a  condition could, among other adverse consequences, affect the  operator's ability \nto control the load. Therefore, OSHA has added an  additional provision, in new Sec.  1926.1414(c), that \nrequires the rope  to be compatible with the safe functioning of the equipment.  Paragraph (d) Boom Hoist \nReeving     With the addition of the two new paragraphs, (b) and (c), OSHA is  redesignating proposed \nparagraphs (b) through (f) of this section as  paragraphs (d) through (h) in the final rule.      Proposed \nparagraph (b) would have prohibited the use of fiber cor e  ropes for boom hoist reeving, except for use on \nderricks.",

Hazards \nAssociated With Cranes and Derricks in Construction Work       OSHA estimates that 89 crane -related \nfatalities occur per year in  construction work. The causes of crane-related fatalities were recently  analyzed \nby Beavers, et al. (See J.E. Beavers, J.R. Moore, R. Rinehart,  and W.R. Schriver, \"Crane-Related Fatalities in the \nConstruction  Industry,\" 132 Journal of Construction Engin eering and Management 901  (Sept. 2006) (ID \nOSHA-2007-0066-0012 \\1\\).) The authors searched OSHA's  Integrated Management Information System \n(IMIS) database for all fatal  accidents for 1997 -2003 investigated by OSHA involving cranes in the  \nconstruction industry. By searching the database for cases using the  key words \"crane,\" \"derrick,\" or \"boom,\" \nthey identified 381 IMIS  files for the covered year in the Federal program states, which include  states with \nabout 57% of all workers throughout the country.

(ID-0214.1.) He further recommended  that the \nrequested guidance should be set forth in the regulatory text  rather than in the preamble if OSHA expects \nemployers to obtain a  written confirmation. OSHA did not determine that written confirmation  is necessary. \nAs long as the utility owner/operator confirms that the  line is de energized and it is visibly grounded, \nemployee safety is  assured. Thus, the final rule does not require written confirmation  that the line is \ndeenergized.     For a discussion of comments related to the requirement for visible  grounding, see the \nsection later in this preamble addressing Sec.   1926.1408(a)(2)(i).     One commenter suggested that in \nsome situations deenergizing and  grounding could place the utility owner/operator in conflict with other  \nFederal and State regulatory requirements. (ID -0203.1.) The commenter  did not provide information for \nOSHA to consider regarding any specific  conflicts, and OSHA has not identified any such conflicts. Moreover, \nin  the event that such a conflict does arise, the employer could choose,  as an alternative to deenergizing, \nOptions (2) or (3) as described  below.     This paragraph is being adopted without change from the \nproposal. Paragraph (a)(2) Option (2)     Under Option (2) (Sec.  1926.1407(a)(2)), the employer is required  \nto maintain a minimum clearance distance of 20 feet. To help ensure  that this distance is not breached, the \nemployer has to implement the  encroachment prevention measures in Sec.  19 26.1407(b). Under this  \noption, no part of the equipment, load or load line, including rigging  and lifting accessories, is permitted \ncloser than 20 feet to the power  line.     Employers using this option will have to stay further away from \nthe  power line than had been required under subpart N's 10 -foot rule  (employers wanting to use the 10-\nfoot rule would have to use Option  (3), discussed below).\\28\\ However, an advantage of this option to many  \nemployers is that they do not have to determine the voltage of the  power line; they only have to determine \nthat the line voltage is no  more than 350 kV.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \n\\28\\ As discussed above, the 10 -foot rule requires varying  clearance distances increasing with voltage with \nclearance distances  that begin at 10 feet.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \nUnder the old subpart N formula, an employee was required at most  to maintain a 20 -foot distance away \nfrom a power line. Under the new  option, employees are required to stay at least 20 feet away from the  \npower line, so the Committee determined that there would be no  diminution of safety under this new option. \nIn fact, in the Committee's  experience, most power lines encountered by most employers have  voltages \nthat, under the current subpart N formula, require a minimum  clearance distance of 10 feet. Therefore, use \nof this option will  result in a higher margin of safety. Employers who do not need to get  closer than 20 feet \nto assemble/disassemble the crane could use this  option and would be saved the step of obtaining the line \nvoltage.     As noted above, in addition to maintaining a minimum clearance  distance of 20 feet, employers \nusing this option are required to  implement the encroachment prevention and other measures specified in  \nSec.  1926.1407(b).  Paragraph (a)(3) Option (3)     Under Option (3) (Sec.  1926.1407(a)(3)), the employer \nis required  to maintain a minimum clearance distance in accordance with Table A of  Sec.  1926.1408. \nUnder Table A, depending on the voltage of the power  line, the minimum clearance distance ranges from 10 \nfeet to 20 feet for  lines up to 350 kV. Under this option the employer is required to  determine the line's \nvoltage.",

Delivering  material to a structure can pose \na hazard that is typically not present  when material is placed on the ground: when the boom is extended, as  \nwhen lifting the material to an upper floor, the possibility of  exceeding the crane's rated capacity, with the \nresultant possibility of  boom collapse and crane tipover, is present. A representative of a  material delivery \ntrade association testified that articulating/ knuckle-boom cranes are equipped with automatic safety systems \nthat  detect whether the crane is close to being overloaded and automatically  prevent such overloading. \n(ID-0341; -0380.1; -0381.1.)     The representative described a test on a crane with a load of 2,900  pounds \nand a maximum extension of 78 feet, 11 inches, and said that the  automatic device preventing the boom \nfrom extending beyond its maximum  safe length for that load and an gle of 46 feet. (ID -0341.) Thus, with a  \nload that is typical of the loads that are often delivered, the hazard  of the crane collapsing exists with the \nboom at far less than its  maximum possible extension. Another representative of the material  delivery \nindustry, also noted the presence of such devices on the  equipment used by its members and, while it asked \nfor such equipment to  be exempt completely from this rule, alternatively suggested an  exemption for \nequipment with such devices installed. (ID-0184.1.)     OSHA is, to a large extent, adopting the commenter's \nsuggestion.  The overloading and subsequent collapse of cranes is one of the primary  hazards this final rule \nseeks to address. The trade association  witness's testimony shows that the potential for collapse is present  \nwhen articulating/knuckle-boom cranes are used to deliver materials  onto a structure. The industry has, \nhowever, addressed this hazard by  equipping such cranes with automatic overload prevention devices.  \nTherefore, OSHA is e xcluding articulating/knuckle-boom cranes used to  deliver materials onto a structure \nfrom the final rule, but only when  the cranes are equipped with properly functioning automatic overload  \nprevention devices. Without such a device, the crane is subject to all  provisions of this final rule. It should be \nnoted that electrical  contact with power lines is another serious hazard covered by the final  rule. The \nlimited exemption for articulating/knuckle -boom cranes used  for certain construction operations also \nexempts this equipment from  the requirements for operations near power lines contained in the final  rule. \nWhen performing an exempt operation, this equipment (like must of  the other exempt equipment and \noperations) will be covered by revised  Sec.  1926.600(a)(6).      OSHA is limiting this exclusion to the \ndelivery of sheet goods and  packaged materials including, but not limited to: sheets of sheet rock,  sheets \nof plywood, bags of cement, sheets or packages of roofing  shingles, and rolls of roofing felt. The placement \nof other materials  on a structure under construction is the type of core construction  activity this rule seeks \nto address, and excluding the hoisting and movement  of other types of materials, su ch as precast concrete \nmembers, prefabricated  building sections, or structural steel members, would severely reduce the  rule's \neffectiveness. Moreover, equipment used to lift these types of materials  on construction sites is rarely, if ever, \nused for no n-construction activities  on those sites and does not often present the problem of equipment \nmoving  in and out of coverage when used for different activities.     OSHA is also limiting the exclusion by \nmaking it clear that it does  not apply when the cra ne is used to hold, support or stabilize the  material to \nfacilitate a construction activity, such as holding  material in place while it is attached to the structure. For \nexample,  while placing a package of shingles onto the roof of a structure would  fall within the exemption, \nsuspending the shingles in the air and  moving them to follow the progress of the roofer would not. When the  \ncrane is being used to facilitate the construction activity, it has  exceeded the \"delivery\" of goods and is \ntherefore engaged in a  process that is more complex than the scenarios addressed by the  commenters who",

Note 1: This is the \"voltage\" of the \npower line for the purposes of the final rule.       Unless the power lines are deenergized and grounded, \nencroachment/ electrocution prevention measures have to be implemented to prevent the  crane from \nbreaching a minimum clearance distance and protect against  electrocution. The employer is allowed to \nchoose among several minimum  clearance distance options.     For example, for lines up to 350kV, the \nminimum clearance distance  options would be: (1) 20 feet; or (2) the distance specified in Table A  of Sec.  \n1926.1408 for the line's voltage (Table A is the \"10-foot  rule\"; see discussion of Table A in discussion of Sec.  \n1926.1408); or  (3) a distance closer than what is specified in Table A.     However, there are limitations to \nthe availability of some of these  options, and the number of mandatory encroachment prev ention (and  \nother) measures increases when using a clearance distance closer than  Table A.     A commenter stated \nthat use of the term \"employer\" was confusing  when there are multiple employers on a given construction \nsite, and  raised the issue of whet her each employer was responsible for employing  its own dedicated \nspotter and its own set of barricades and similar  safety measures. (ID-0143.1.)     In general, except where \notherwise specified in this standard, the  requirements of this standard apply to employers whose employees \nare  exposed to hazards addressed by this standard, and also to other  employers in certain situations as \nexplained in OSHA's multi -employer  policy (see OSHA CPL 02 -00-124, Multi-Employer Citation Policy, Dec.  \n10, 1999). For example, with respect to situations in which barricades,  a dedicated spotter, or other measures \nare required under Sec. Sec.   1926.1407-1926.1411, each such employer is responsible for ensuring  that \nthe required measures are in place. However, that does not mean  that each employer is required to install or \nprovide duplicate sets of  those measures. In multiple employer worksites, one employer may rely  on \nmeasures provided by another employer as long as those measures meet  the requirements of the standard.     \nSeveral commenters asked that OSHA specify in the standard that  utility owner/operators may charge fees \nfor the services they are  required to perform under the standard. (ID-0155.1; -0203.1.) For  example, where \nthe employer uses Sec.  1926.1408 (a)(2)(iii)'s Option  (3) for setting the clearance distance (i.e., the \nclearance distance  under Table A), under Sec.  1926.1408(c), the utility owner/operator  must provide \nrequested voltage information within two working days of  the request.     The standard does not address",

The  specific issues addressed by \nthese commenters with respect to the  application of this rule to electric utilities will be addressed below  in \nsections dealing with those issues.      A commenter that operates shipyards in three states asks that  \nshipyards be excluded from the standard. (ID-0195.1.) This commenter  states that it currently has an excellent \ncrane safety program that is  based on general industry and shipyard standards, and asserts that its  program \nwould be adversely affected by the need to administer a separate  program for the \"small percentage of lifts\" \nthat would fall under the  construction standard. The commenter notes that the proposed standard  has \npartially addressed its concern by providing that overhead and gantry  cranes that are permanently installed \nin a facility are subject to the  general indus try standard for such cranes rather than this proposed  \nconstruction standard. It states that shipyards \"could potentially\" use  other types of cranes to support \nconstruction activities at its sites.     OSHA finds that the proposed rule appropriately addressed this  issue. \nOverhead and gantry cranes are one of the most common type of  crane used in shipyards and, as the \ncommenter notes, Sec.  1926.1438  allows employers with permanently installed overhead and gantry \ncranes  to continue to follow the general industry standard. Moreover, 29 CFR  1915.2(a), provides that the \nshipyard standards \"apply to all ship  repairing, shipbuilding and shipbreaking employments and related  \nemployments.\" Therefore, some work that would otherwise be considered  construction work and subject to \nsubpart CC is in fact included in such  \"related employments.\" Therefore, subpart CC will likely affect  \nshipyards only to a limited extent.      While it is understandable that the commenter may find it more  \nconvenient to administer a single program addressing only the general  industry and shipyard standards, it has \nnot substantiated its claim  that the integration of this standard into that program or  implementation of an \nadditional program addressing this standard would  not improve safety. The Agency notes that the \ncommenter's construction  operations have historically been subject to part 1926 subpart N.      A \nrepresentative of employers who install signs in buildings asks  that sign erection be excluded from the \nstandard. (ID-0189.1.) This  commenter says that sign erection is low -risk work because most signs  are \nrelatively light (rarely exceeding 2,000 pounds) and the equipment  used is \"light duty \" equipment with \nrelatively simple operating  controls. For heavier signs, it states that sign installers typically  hire crane \ncompanies that employ certified and professional crane  operators. The commenter notes that proposed Sec.  \n1926.1441 would  exempt equipment with a rated capacity of 2,000 pounds or less from the  standard but \nsays this would not provide the industry with relief  because sign installers must use higher capacity cranes \ndue to the  reach needed to install signs. Although it asks for complete exclusion,  the commenter makes \nclear that its objection pertains to the  requirement for operator qualification/certification in Sec.   \n1926.1427. It asks for less stringent requirements for its industry,  such as employer self -certification and a \nbroader range of training and  certifying entities, such as accredited educational institutions.      OSHA \ndeclines to exempt sign installation from the standard. Using  cranes for sign installation on construction sites \ninvolves the same  hazards as when  used for other purposes. Examples include installation  of signs near \npower lines; operation of the crane at an extended radius  due to the need for long reach, which can heighten \nthe risk of tip- over; the risk to the sign installers of losing the load; failures due  to poor equipment condition \nor miscommunication between the operator  and signal person. Finally, the commenter's objections to the \noperator  qualification/certification requirements for its industry parallels  objections raised by others and \nwill be addressed in the discussion of  Sec.  1926.1427.

OSHA also received a comment suggesting that the plan-review  requirement \nin proposed Sec.  1926.1432(b)(2) did not make clear the  intention that the review take place in a meeting \nso that the plan  could be reviewed collectively with the workers as a group. (ID- 0182.1.) Because a collective \nreview is more likely to be effective  than separate, individual reviews, OSHA agrees with the commenter's  \nclarification and has inserted the phrase \"in a meeting\" into final  Sec.  1926.1432(b)(2).      Other than \nthis additional language, the replacement of  \"supervised\" with \"directed,\" and the inclusion of the term \"lift  \ndirector,\" the Agency is promulgating this provision as proposed. Section 1926.1433 Design, Construction and \nTesting     Previously, subpart N included design, construction, and testing  requirements for specific types \nof equipment that either incorporate  pre-1970 consensus standards or that require equipment to conform to  \nmanufacturer's specifications.

Paragraph (d) Load Line Free Fall      Paragraph (d) of this section lists \nthe circumstances under which  free fall of the load line hoist is prohibited, and controlled load  lowering \nmust be used. \"Free fall (of the load line)\" is defined in  Sec.  1926.1401 to mean \"where only the brake is \nused to regulate the  descent of the load line (the drive mechanism is not used to drive the  load down faster \nor retard its lowering).\" \"Free fall\" is contrasted  with \"controlled load lowering,\" which Sec.  1926.1401 \ndefines as  \"lowering a load by means of a mechanical hoist drum device that  allows a hoisted load to be \nlowered with maximum control using the gear  train or hydraulic components of the hoist mechanism. \nControlled load  lowering requires the use of the hoist drive motor, rather than the  load hoist brake, to lower \nthe load.\"     As with free fall of the boom, free fall of the load line hoist  presents a struck-by hazard to \nemployees. One difference is that free  fall of the load line endangers a smaller area than boom free fall.  \nWhen a boom free falls, its tip (and any attached load) moves both  downward and outward. Because the load \nwill be moving in at least two  directions simultaneously, the area that will be affected by the fall  is larger \nthan the affected area from a load line free fall.      In contrast, if a load line free falls, th e load will tend to \nfall  in a relatively straight path downward (as long as the boom is not  being moved and the load is not",

(See the discussion of this provision at 73 FR \n59745, Oct. 9,  2008.)     Several commenters stated that proper blocking is necessary for  hydraulic \ncranes in addition to lattice boom cranes.

In addition, this \nsection does not apply to  equipment traveling on a construction site with a load. That situation  is governed \nby Sec. Sec.  1926.1408, 1926.1409, and 1926.1410. To make  this clear, OSHA is adding the language to \nparagraph (a) specifying  that Sec. Sec.  1926.1408, 192 6.1409, and 1926.1410, whichever is  appropriate, \ngovern equipment traveling on a construction site with a  load. Paragraph (b)     Under paragraph (b)(1) of \nthis section, the boom/mast and boom/mast  support system must be lowered sufficiently to meet the  \nrequirements of  this paragraph. Paragraph (b)(2) specifies that the clearances  specified in Table T of this \nsection must be maintained. The values in  Table T, which provides the minimum clearance distances while \ntraveling  with no load and a lowered boom, are substantially similar to the  values used in sec. 5-3.4.5.5 of \nASME B30.5 -2004.     In the proposed rule, the heading of Table T read: \"MINIMUM  CLEARANCE \nDISTANCES WITH NO LOAD AND BOOM/MAST LOWERED.\" In addition,  each clearance distance in the table \nwas followed by the following  parenthetical: \"(while traveling, boom lowered).\" OSHA determines  that the \nreferences to the boom in the heading and parentheticals could  be confusing. The intent of the table is to \nestablish minimum clearance  distances while the crane is traveling, not clearance distances with  the boom \nlowered. As noted in the discussion of Sec.  1926.1411(b)(1),  the boom and/or mast must be lowered \nsufficiently to comply with Table  T; it is not a prerequisite to the applicability of Table T.  Accordingly, in the \nfinal rule, the words \"AND BOOM/MAST LOWERED\" are  deleted from the heading of Table T, and the \nparentheticals are also  removed from the clearance distances in the table.      Section 1926.1411(b)(3) \nrequires the employer to ensure that the  effects of speed and terrain are considered so that those effects do  \nnot cause the minimum clearance distances specified in Table T to be  breached. Sections 1926.1411(b)(1)-(3) \nare promulgated as propose d.     Section 1926.1411(b)(4) requires the employer to use a dedicated  \nspotter if any part of the equipment while traveling will get closer  than 20 feet to a power line. This provision \nalso requires that the  dedicated spotter be in continuous contact with the crane operator; be  positioned to \neffectively gauge the clearance distance; where  necessary, use equipment that enables the spotter to \ncommunicate  directly with the crane operator; and give timely information to the  crane operator so that \nthe re quired clearance distance can be  maintained. See the earlier discussion of spotters in Sec. Sec.   \n1926.1407 and 1926.1408.      In reviewing proposed Sec.  1926.1411(b)(4), OSHA noted that the  \nlanguage \"crane operator\" was used rather than \"driver.\" Beca use  Sec.  1926.1411 deals with power line \nsafety while equipment is  traveling without a load, OSHA recognized that the language \"crane  operator\" \nmay not be appropriate in all situations. In some cases a  crane operator may not be the driver of such \nequipment on the  construction site. Therefore, OSHA solicited comments on whether the  language \"crane \noperator\" used in proposed Sec.  1926. 1411(b)(4)  should be changed to \"driver\" or \"driver/operator.\" The \ntwo  commenters who addressed this issue supported changing the language to  \"driver/operator.\" (ID-\n0205.1; -0213.1.) Therefore, this change to  the regulatory text has been made in the final rule.",

Moreover, the fact that \nsafety-conscious m embers  of private industry voluntarily helped to develop a third -party  certification \nprocess before there was a government mandate to do so is  further evidence that certification promotes \nsafety. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\109\\ As explained in the Introduction, \nunder C-DAC ground  rules, a \"consensus\" was reached on an issue if there were no more  than two non-\nFederal dissenters.     \\110\\ It is also supported by the data from Ontario and  California showing that third-\nparty certification can significantly  reduce crane-related fatalities and injuries, discussed below. ----------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------      As discussed earlier, a number of commenters urged OSHA \nto require  training rather than certification. But training alone is insufficient  without a means of verifying \nthat each operator understands the  training well enough to operate safely and is sufficiently skilled to  \nimplement what he/she has been taught. As Graham Brent, Executive  Director of NCCCO put it at the hearing, \n\"[c]ertification * * * is an  employer's, as well as the general public's, be st assurance that the  required \ntraining has not only been effective, but that learning has  taken place during the training process.\" (ID-0343.) \nOSHA's current  training standard has not prevented the high number of crane-related  fatalities and serious \ninjuries that have been occurring as a result of  improper operation.     OSHA acknowledges that many \nemployers have effective training  programs and highly competent crane operators. However, the rulemaking  \nrecord shows that a training requirement alone i s insufficient to  ensure that crane operators have the \nrequisite level of competence.  This was the opinion of the members of C-DAC and is shared by many of  the \nmembers of the public who commented on the proposed rule and who  testified at the public hearing.     A \nrepresentative of the building industry objects to OSHA's  reliance on the study by the Construction Safety \nAssociation of  Ontario, saying that it does not meet statutory and regulatory  information quality standards, \nincluding the Department of Labor's  Information Quality Guidelines. \\111\\ (ID-0232.1.) First, OSHA notes  \nthat the Ontario study is only part of the record evidence on which the  Agency relies in promulgating this \nstandard. In the preamble to the  proposed rule, OSHA stated that t he Ontario study \"buttressed\" C - DAC's \nexperience and conclusions regarding the need for independent  testing of operator ability (see 73 FR 59810, \nOct. 9, 2008). Second,  OSHA's reliance on that study does comply with the Department's  guidelines. \nAppendix II of the guidelines addresses the information  quality principles on which OSHA relies in setting \nhealth and safety  standards. For safety standards, such as this rule, OSHA must use \"the  best available \nstatistical data from surveys of fatalities, injuries,  and illnesses, and the best available peer-reviewed science \nand  supporting studies that describe the nature of the safety risks being  addressed.\" OSHA determines that \nthe Ontario study, though not peer- reviewed, is the \"best available statistical data\" showing the  efficacy of \nthird-party operator certification. The California study is  similarly supportive of the C-DAC conclusions. -------\n--------------------------------------------------------------------      \\111\\ \"Guidelines for Ensuring and Maximizing the \nQuality,  Objectivity, Utility, and Integrity of Information Disseminated by  the Department of Labor,\" (Oct. 1, \n2002), available on the  Department of Labor's Web site. --------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------      In other respects as well, OSHA has complied with the Department of  Labor's Information \nQuality Guidelines. The guidelines state that  \"[t]he goal of a safety risk analysis is to describe the numbers,  \nrates, and causal nature of injuries related to the safety risks being  addressed.\" To meet this goal, OSHA \nhistorically has \"relied on  injury and illness statistics from BLS, combined with incident or  accident reports \nfrom enforcement activities, incident or accident  reports submitted to the record from the private or public",

Paragraph (b) Operation --Procedures     Paragraph (b)(1) of this section states that Sec.  \n1926.1417  (Operation) of this standard applies to derricks except for Sec.   1926.1417(c) (Accessibility of \nprocedures). C-DAC concluded and OSHA  agreed that it was appropriate to keep the operation requirements \nfor  derricks consistent with those of cranes as much as possible because  they both present many of the \nsame hazards and operational issues.  However, Sec.  1926.1417(c) requires the operatin g procedures,  \nincluding load charts, to be located in \"the cab\" of the equipment  and derricks often do not have a cab. \nTherefore, it was not appropriate  to require that Sec.  1926.1417(c) apply to derricks.

In \nparticular, Sec. Sec.  1926.1412(f)(4) -(6) on annual  inspections require the qualified person who conducts \nthe inspection to  determine whether a deficiency is a safety hazard that requires  immediate correction or \nwhether it is not yet a safety hazard but is of  sufficient concern to be monitored in the monthly inspections.     \nOSHA determines that a similar approach is appropriate here because  a deficiency revealed in a pre-erection \ninspection may be sufficiently  serious that a component should not be used at all, or it may not  presently \nbe a safety hazard but may be a matter of concern to the  inspector so as to require periodic scrutiny. \nAccordingly, paragraph  (f)(2)(ii) requires the qualified person who conducts the inspection to  determine, \nbefore a component is erected, whether the component would  create a safety hazard if used on the crane. If \nso, the component  cannot be used unless it is repaired and upon re-inspection is found  not to constitute a \nsafety hazard.     Paragraph (f)(2)(iii) specifies that, if the qualified person  determines that, though not \npresently a safety hazard, the component  needs to be monitored, the employer mu st ensure that the \ncomponent is  checked in the monthly inspections. To ensure that any individual who  conducts a monthly \ninspection knows that the component must be  monitored during that inspection, paragraph (f)(2)(iii) requires \nthat  any such determination be documented and the documentation made  available to any person who \nconducts a monthly inspection.      Proposed paragraph (f)(2) specified two additional post -erection  \ninspection requirements in addition to those required under Sec.   1926.1412(c). It required a load test using \ncertified weights, or  scaled weights using a certified scale with a current certificate of  calibration, after each \nerection. It also specified that the load test  be conducted in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, \nor if  no instructions are available, in accordance with written load test  procedures developed by a \nregistered professional engineer. No adverse  comment was received on these provisions, and proposed \nparagraph (f)(2)  is promulgated as proposed but renumbered as paragraph (f)(3).     Proposed paragraph \n(f)(3) required that additional items be  included in the monthly inspections of tower cranes. These include  \ntower (mast) bolts and other structural bolts (for loose or dislodged  condition) from the base of the tower up \nor, if the crane is tied to or  braced by the structure, those above the upper -most brace support  (Sec.  \n1926.1435(f)(3)(i)). The monthly inspection must also include  the upper-most tie-in, braces, floor supports, \nand floor wedges where  the tower crane is supported by the structure (Sec.   1926.1435(f)(3)(i)), for loose \nor dislodged components.     One commenter's suggestion addressed the suita bility of the bolts  used to \nerect the tower and to support the turntable. (ID -0172.1.)  Although OSHA agrees with the commenter that \nthese bolts serve an  important safety function, the commenter did not provide any supporting  information \nthat would enab le OSHA to evaluate whether the detailed  requirements proposed by the commenter are \nneeded to improve tower  crane safety. However, OSHA does determine that the bolts should be  included \nas components to be inspected and is adding paragraph (f)(5)  requiring them to be inspected for proper \ncondition and torque as part  of the annual inspection.\\134\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------\n------------      \\134\\ Accordingly, OSHA is promulgating proposed paragraph  (f)(3) but renumbe ring it as \nparagraph (f)(4). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      A commenter suggested that \nthe upper rotation structure should  undergo a special, thorough inspection before climbing. (ID -0137.1.)  \nThis commenter did not state why it believed such an inspection was  needed. Accordingly, OSHA has no basis \nin the record to conclude that  the additional inspection requested by this commenter would improve the  \nsafety of the climbing operation.

C-DAC intended these precautions to be taken in lieu of \nrequiring  boom angle indicators and that they are unnecessary if the derrick has  such a device. Therefore, \nOSHA requested public comment on whether  proposed Sec.  1926.1436(f)(2) should be modified by adding \nthe words,  \"If the derrick is not equ ipped with a functioning boom angle  indicator.\"     Several \ncommenters supported OSHA's recommended revision of Sec.   1926.1436(f)(2) but noted that the language \nshould be more explicit in  stating that a boom angle indicator is not required. (ID-0180.1; - 0213.1; -0205.1.) \nThey also asked OSHA to clarify that the options  provided in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section are \nnot  required when boom angle indicators are used. To address these  concerns, OSHA has modified the \nlanguage of Sec.  1926.1436(f)(2) to  clarify that while a boom angle indicator is not required, if the  derrick \nhas a boom angle indicator, the employer need n ot use the  options provided in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) and (ii) \nunless the boom angle  indicator is not functioning.     Paragraph (f)(3) of this section, Load weight/capacity \ndevices,  requires that derricks manufactured more than November 8, 2011 with a  maximum rated capacity \nover 6,000 pounds have at least one of the  following: load weighing device, load moment indicator, rated \ncapacity  indicator, or rated capacity limiter. This paragraph adopts, for  derricks, a requirement comparable \nto that required for cranes under  Sec.  1926.1416(e)(4). Because this paragraph imposes a requirement not  \npreviously applied to derricks by an industry standard, OSHA concludes,  as did C-DAC, that it is appropriate \nto allow one year after this  standard becomes effective for new derricks to be equipped with such  devices.     \nParagraph (f)(3) sets temporary alternative measures that must be  used when the load weight/capacity \ndevice is not working properly. In  that case the weight of the load must be determined from a s ource  \nrecognized by the industry (e.g., the load's manufacturer), or by a  calculation method recognized by the \nindustry (e.g., calculating a  steel beam from measured dimensions and a known per foot weight). This  \ninformation must be provided to the operator before the lift. These  temporary alternatives are the same as \nthose required by Sec.   1926.1416(e)(5) for equipment generally and under Sec.   1926.1435(e)(6)(vi) for \ntower cranes specifically. For purposes of  clarification, the Agency has added a reference to Sec.   \n1926.1436(f)(3)(i) noting that the requirements of Sec.  1926.1417(j)  are applicable. (See further discussion \nat Sec.  1926.1417(j).)      Under Sec. Sec.  1926.1416(e) and 1926.1435(e)(6), a load weight/  capacity \ndevice is a category II operational aid and, as such, it must  be repaired within 30 days if it is not working \nproperly.     OSHA requested comment on whether to apply that same 30-day  requirement, along with the \nexception for a situation in which a part  is ordered within 7 days of the malfunction but is not received in \ntime  to complete the repair within 30 days.     Several commenters supported a revision of paragraph (f)(3) \nof this  section to include the recommended time limits. (ID -0205.1; -0213.1; - 0343.) OSHA concludes it is \nreasonable to make this revision for  consistency with alternatives that are available to crane users during  \nthe repair of similar operational aids .",

(ID -\n0343.) Although some  of these are not available to all employers or crane operators, it does  not appear that \nthere will be a lack of availability of testing  services under Option (1), particularly with the four-year phase-\nin  period for Sec.  1926.1427.      In addition, the record shows that testing organizations arrange  for \ntesting to be available at convenient locations. For example, NCCCO  offers the written test anywhere in the \ncountry where it receives  adequate notice and an appropriate testing room is available. (ID - 0343.) NCCCO \nalso sends examiners to an employer's worksite to  administer the practical tests. (ID-0343.) OSHA therefore \nconcludes  that the current four options afford crane operators and their  employers sufficient opportunity \nto obtain qualification/certification  and that additional options are not needed to make such services  \nreadily available.      Two building trade associations recom mended that OSHA add an option  that \ncombines aspects of Option (2) of this section with tests  developed by an accredited educational institution. \n(ID-0218.1; - 0232.1.) Under their recommendation, the educational institution would  develop written and \npractical tests, and the tests would be approved by  an auditor who is certified by an accredited educational \ninstitution as  qualified to evaluate such tests. The actual operator certification  would be issued by the \naccredited educational institution.      OSHA determines that this recommended program is, in practical  \neffect, not significantly different than the general recommendation for  OSHA to allow certificati on by an \naccredited educational institution.  First, it is likely that educational institutions would be  administering tests \nto individuals who have taken their training  courses without \"firewall\" separation between those functions,  \nthereby giving rise to the problem addressed above that testing would  not be independent of training and \nwould therefore be of reduced  reliability. Second, although the commenters would not permit the  auditor \nto be employed by the employer, there is no prohibition against  the auditor being employed by the accredited \neducational institution  who certifies him/her. In OSHA's view, this creates the potential for a  conflict of \ninterest because the auditor would not be independent of  the institution whose tests he or she is reviewing. \nOSHA finds that the  recommendation by the commenters does not contain sufficient safeguards  to ensure \nthat the tests provide an indicator of operator competence  that is comparable to the other options permitted \nunder this rule.     One commenter asked OSHA to prohibit different organizations from  administering the \nwritten and practical testing. (ID-0199.1.) The  commenter stated that it is necessary for one organization to \nmaintain  oversight of the entire test process. The commenter did not provide any  support for this assertion, \nnor has OSHA identified any other evidence  in the record to support it. OSHA does not find the request \npersuasive  and is instead relying on the accreditation requirements to ensure that  the certifying entity \nadministers all testing appropriately. Paragraph (f) Pre-Qualification/Certification Training Period     Section \n1926.1427(f) establishes a process by which operators who  are not certified or qualified can get experience \noperating the  equipment to help prepare for obtaining a certification/qualification.  Section 1926.1427(f) \nallows employees who are not yet qualified or  certified to operate cranes provided that they qualify as \n\"operators- in-training\" in accordance with Sec. Sec.  1926.1427(f)(1) through  (5), which require appropriate \nmonitoring of such operators-in-training  to ensure worksite safety and places limitations on the tasks they \ncan  perform. OSHA revised proposed Sec.  1926.1427(f) to clarify that  employees who do me et the \nrequirements of an \"operator-in-training,\"  and who are not otherwise certified or qualified under this section,  \nare prohibited from operating equipment (except for maintenance, as  provided in Sec.  1926.1429 of this \nsubpart). OSHA has removed the  text  that was in proposed paragraph (f)(2) as redundant, \\118\\ and has",

Most of the commenters \non this issue favored an exclusion for  digger derricks but asked that the proposed exclusion be broadened to  \nall uses of digger derricks by electric utilities. (ID-0129.1; -0139.1;  -0144.1; -0162.1; -0200.1; -0215.1; -0217.1; \n-0226.) Several noted that  the proposed exclusion would lead to the incongruous result in that  digger \nderricks would move in and out of coverage depending on the task  they are performing. Noting that most of \nthe exclusions developed by C- DAC applied to types of equipment rather than specific tasks, a  commenter \nstated that C -DAC contradicts itself by proposing a task - related exclusion instead of an equipment -related \nexclusion. (ID- 0200.1.) One commenter recommended that the proposed excl usion be  extended to the \nsetting and removal of poles. (ID-0209.1.) Another  opposed any exclusion for digger derricks because digger \nderricks work  in proximity to power lines. (ID-0092.20.)     Some commenters suggested that any exclusion \nfor digger derricks  should also apply to other industries. One stated that a similar  exclusion should apply to \ndigger derricks used to auger holes and set  poles in the telecommunication industry. (ID -0234.) Another \ncontended  that it would be inconsistent to exclude a digger derrick used to set  an electric utility pole but \nnot a telecommunications pole. (ID- 0129.1.) The same commenter also said that digger derricks are used to  \nset poles for outdoor lighting along roadways and indicated that the  exclusion should apply to such use. A \ncommenter in the railroad  industry said that the exclusion should apply to digger derricks used  in the \nrailroad industry to install utility and communication signal  poles. (ID -0176.1.)     Certain commenters \ncriticized the description  of the equipment in  proposed paragraph (c)(4), which described the equipment \nsubject to the  exclusion as \"service trucks with mobile -lifting devices designed  specifically for use in the \npower line and electric service industries,  such as digger derric ks (radial boom derricks).\" One objected to \nthe  limitation that the equipment be \"designed specifically for use in the  power line and electric service \nindustries\" on the basis that  employers should not be required to show the purpose for which their  \nequipment is designed. (ID-0215.1.) Another, a witness at the public  hearing, stated that the term \"service \ntruck\" used in the proposal  has no commonly understood meaning in the industry. (ID -0342.)     OSHA \nagrees with these commenters that the description of the  excluded machinery should be clarified and is using \nthe term \"digger  derrick\" exclusively to describe the equipment that is s ubject to the  exclusion. The term \n\"digger derrick\" is well understood in the  industry and is the only term used to describe the equipment by \nthe  ANSI standard applicable to such equipment, ANSI/ASSE A10.31-2006,  Safety Requirements, Definitions, \nand Sp ecifications for Digger  Derricks. Accordingly, OSHA concludes that using \"digger derrick\"  without \nreference to the purpose for which the equipment is designed or  synonyms such as \"service truck\" is the \nclearest way to describe the  exclusion. The Agency notes that despite its name, a \"digger derrick\"  is not a \n\"derrick\" as defined in Sec.  1926.1436(a). Thus, the  additional requirements applicable to derricks in Sec.  \n1926.1436 do  not apply to digger derricks, and the exception from operator  certification requirements in \nSec.  1926.1427(c) for derrick operators  does not apply to operators of digger derricks included within the  \nscope of Sec.  1926 subpart CC.",

Thus  the area affected will typically be smaller. As a result the  prohibitions \nfor load line free fall are less than those affiliated  with boom free fall. No comments were received on \nparagraphs (d)(1) or  (d)(2); they are promulgated as proposed.      Proposed paragraph (d)(3) stated that \nthe use of load line hoist  free fall is prohibited when the load is directly over a power line, or  over any part \nof the area extending the Table A clearance distance to  each side of the power line. OSHA requested comment \non whether proposed  Sec.  1926.1426(d)(3) should be modified t o also prohibit the equipment  from being \npositioned where the fall path of the load would breach the  Table A clearance distance. One commenter, in \ntwo comments agreed with  the change and no commenters disagreed. (ID-0052.0; -0092.1.)     Since this \nmodification is consistent with the purpose of the  provision, OSHA has included this revised language in the \nfinal rule;  Sec.  1926.1426(d)(3) to prohibit load line free fall where the power  line or the Table A clearance \ndistance is within the fall path of the  load.     Proposed paragraph (d)(4) stated that load line free fall is  \nprohibited when the load is over a shaft or cofferdam. OSHA noted that,  unlike the prohibition against live \nbooms in Sec.  1926.1426(a)(1)(v),  proposed paragraph (d)(4) contained no exception regarding cofferdams  \nin which there are no employees in the fall zone. OSHA requested  comment on whether proposed Sec.  \n1926.1426(d)(4) should include the  same exception included in Sec.  1926.1426(a)(1)(v). Two commenters  \nagreed with the modification and no commenters disagreed. (ID-0205; - 0213.) Because the fall zone of a free \nfalling load line is typically a  smaller area than the fall zone of a free falling boom, the Agency is  unaware of \nany reason to include the exception in Sec.   1926.1426(a)(1)(v) for live booms but omit it for load free fall.  \nTherefore, in the final rule, OSHA has modified the language in  proposed Sec.  1926.1426(d) by separately \naddressing shafts and  cofferdams, and adding an exception for the latter.  Section 1926.1427 Operator \nQualification and Certification Introduction     Section 1926.1427 addresses the safety problems that result \nif  equipment operators lack the knowledge and skills necessary to perform  their duties safely. In C-DAC's \ncollective experience, operator error  plays a role in a significant percentage of fatal and other serious  crane \naccidents because operators are not familiar with the precautions  needed to protect against hazards such as \npower line contact, crane  overloading and collapse, and loss of control of the load. C-DAC  concluded that a \nverified testing process is essential for ensuring  that crane operators have the requisite knowledge and skills \nand that  requiring crane operators to successfully complete such a process would  be an effective and \nefficient way to reduce crane-related accidents.     In the proposed rule, OSHA noted that C-DAC's finding in \nthis  regard was supported by a study conducted over a 34-year period (1969- 2002) by the Construction Safety \nAssociation of Ontario that showed a  substantial decrease in crane and rigging fatalities in Ontario  \nbeginning in 1979, when mandatory training and certification  requirements for Ontario crane operators went \ninto effect. (ID-0009.)  In the ten-year period from 1969 through 1978, before Ontario's  requirements went \ninto effect, 85 Ontario construction workers suffered  crane and rigging fatalities, amounting to 8.5 per year, \nor 19.8% of  all construction fatalities in Ontario. In the 24-year period from 1979  through 2002, there were \n51 crane and rigging fatalities, or slightly  more than two per year. For this period, crane and rigging fatalities  \nequaled 9.6% of all Ontario construction fatalities.",

The rule therefore distinguishes between permanently installed  overhead and gantry \ncranes and those that are not permanently  installed. Overhead and gantry cranes permanently installed in a  \nfacility are considered an irremovable part of the property and are  primarily used in general industry but may, \non rare occasions, be used  for construction activities. Generally, these cranes are installed in  facilities and \nare not easily assembled or disassembled. They are  typically physically fastened to a building and enhance \nthe utility of  the property. The requirements of Sec.  1910.179, the general industry  standard, and not \nsubpart CC, apply to these permanently installed  overhead and gantry cranes.     In contrast, overhead and \ngantry cranes used frequently for  construction activities are generally not permanently installed in a  facility. \nThey tend to be more easily assembled or disassembled than  their permanently installed counterparts. The \ndetermining factor of  whether an overhead or gantry crane is or is not permanently installed  is whether or \nnot it is regarded as a permanent part of the facility.  If it is intended as a temporary installation or meant to \nbe removed  from the property, then the overhead or gantry crane is not considered  permanently installed, \nand subpart CC applies. For example, if an  employer attaches the base of a gantry crane to a concrete slab at \na  building construction site for use in constructing the building, that  gantry crane would be covered by the \nprovisions in subpart CC.  Paragraph (a) Permanently Installed Overhead and Gantry Cranes      Section \n1926.1438(a) applies the requirements of Sec.  1910.179,  with the exception of Sec.  1910.179(b)(1), to six \nlisted types of  cranes an d \"others with fundamentally similar characteristics,\" when  they are used in \nconstruction and are permanently installed in a  facility. The requirements in subpart CC do not apply to these \ncranes.  Section 1910.179(b)(1) sets forth the scope of the genera l industry  standard as defined under 29 \nCFR part 1910. It is excluded to avoid any  confusion that might arise from having two separate scope \nprovisions  applicable to Sec.  1926.1438(a). Nonetheless, the types of overhead  and gantry cranes \ncovered under Sec. Sec.  1926.1438(a) and  1910.179(b)(1) are the same, in that they all share fundamental  \ncharacteristics. These cranes are grouped because they all have  trolleys and similar travel characteristics.  \nParagraph (b) Overhead and Gantry Cranes That Are Not Permanently  Installed in a Facility     Paragraph \n(b)(1) of this section provides the scope of Sec.   1926.1438(b). By its terms, Sec.  1926.1438(b) pertains to \noverhead and  gantry cranes, overhead/br idge cranes, semigantry cranes, cantilever  gantry cranes, wall \ncranes, storage bridge cranes, launching gantry  cranes, and similar equipment having the same fundamental  \ncharacteristics, when they are used in construction and are not permanently  installed in a facility. The words \n\"having the same fundamental characteristics\"  have been added to be consistent with the language in Sec.  \n1926.1438(a).     Paragraph (b)(2) specifies which requirements apply to the  equipment identified in Sec.  \n1926.1438(b)(1).     Paragraph (b)(2)(i) requires overhead and gantry cranes not  permanently installed in \na facility to comply with Sec. Sec.  1926.1400  through 1926.1414; Sec. Sec.  1926.1417 through 1926.1425; \nSec.   1926.1426(d); Sec. Sec.  1926.1427 through 1926. 1434; Sec. Sec.   1926.1437, 1926.1439, and \n1926.1441 of subpart CC.",

Section 1926.1415 Safety \nDevices     This section sets forth the requirements for equi pping cranes and  derricks with certain safety \ndevices and prohibits the use of the  equipment if those devices are not working properly.      The safety \ndevices addressed by this section are devices that C-DAC  determined are essential for the safe operation of \ncranes and derricks  and therefore, required to be present and in proper working order  during all equipment \noperations with no alternative measures permitted.  Those devices considered less critical to equipment \nsafety are  designated as operational aids and are governed by Sec.  1926.1416.  That section allows \nequipment to continue operating if the operational  aid fails or malfunctions but requires certain temporary \nalternative  protective measures in such cases. Those devices designated as safety  devices in this section, \nhowever, are so essential and integral to safe  equipment operation that C-DAC determined that there is no \nacceptable  alternative to having them in proper working order. Paragraph (a) Safety Devices     Paragraph \n(a) of this section lists the safety devices that are  required on all equipment covered by this subpart and \nspecifications  and conditions applicable to those devices (including the exemption of  certain equipment \nfrom the requirements of the listed devices).     Crane Level Indicator: Paragraph (a)(1) requires that a crane \nlevel  indicator be on all equipment covered under this subpart. C-DAC  determined that level equipment is \na key  factor in ensuring equipment  safety. Using a crane level indicator is necessary because it has the  \nrequisite accuracy for leveling the equipment. C -DAC members stressed  the need to use a crane level \nindicator because, if the equipment is  not properly leveled, it will not have all the capacities indicated in  the \nload charts. Reliance on the charts in such situations could cause  the equipment to overturn or otherwise fail.     \nSection 1926.1415(a)(1)(i) specifies that a crane level indicator  must either be built into the equipment or \navailable on it. One  commenter requested clarification of whether the rule allows for the  use of a \ncarpenter's level to satisfy the requirements of proposed  Sec.  1926.1415(a)(1)(i). (ID -0292.1.)     A \ncarpenter's level of sufficient length (such as a four-foot  level), available to the operator, that gives an accurate \nreading,  meets the requirements of this paragraph as proposed; such a level is  typically used in the industry \nfor this purpose. Therefore, it is not  necessary to revise the text of the rule and OSHA is promulgating  \nparagraph (a)(1)(i) as proposed.      Section 1926.1415(a)(1)(ii) addresses the hazard posed by false  \nreadings from non-operational crane level indicators remaining on the  equipment. The Agency is requiring \nbuilt-in (i.e., integral) crane  level indicators that are not working properly to be tagged -out or  removed. \nSimilarly, removable crane level indicators must be remo ved  from the equipment if they are not working \nproperly. Both requirements  are intended to avoid confusion and the operator's inadvertent reliance  on a \ndevice that is not working correctly. OSHA received no comment on  this provision. Therefore, OSHA \npromulgated it as proposed, with the  additional specification that a removable crane level indicator must be  \nremoved prior to operation if it is not working properly.     Paragraph (a)(1)(iii) exempts portal cranes,\\78\\ \nderricks, floating  cranes/derricks and land cranes/derricks on barges, pontoons, vessels,  or other means of \nflotation from the requirements of Sec.   1926.1415(a)(1). C -DAC members indicated that these types of \nequipment  are leveled and then fixed in place when installed, precluding the n eed  for a crane level \nindicator.\\79\\ OSHA received no comment on this provision.  Therefore, OSHA is promulgating paragraph \n(a)(1)(iii) as proposed. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\78\\ Section 1926.1401 \ndefines \"portal crane\" as a \"type of  crane consisting of a rotating upperstructure, hoist machinery, and  \nboom mounted on top of a structural gantry which may be fixed in one  location or have travel capability.",

Similarly, although \none contractor indicated a desire to be  able to obtain power line voltage information immediately at all times  \nthrough Internet services provided by the utility owner/operator (ID- 0118.1), other contractors indicated that \na two working day time frame  was manageable from a construction planning standpoint (ID-0205.1; - 0213.1). \nIn light of these comments, OSHA concludes that the proposed  two-day requirement to fulfill voltage \ninformation requests was a  reasonable time frame for both contractors and utility owners/ operators. --------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------      \\41\\ One electric utility representative at the public \nhearing  did request, however, that the time period for responding to a  request be changed to four business \ndays. (ID -0342.) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      In the proposed rule \npreamble, the Agency noted that the C-DAC  provision read:      Voltage information. Where Option (3) is \nused, owner/operators  of power lines must provide the requested voltage information within  two working \ndays of the employer's request.  In a different context--determining the timeliness of notices of  contest to \nOSHA citations --OSHA defines \"working  days\" to mean  \"Mondays through Fridays but shall not include \nSaturdays, Sundays, or  Federal holidays.\" 29 CFR 1903.22(c). Since the term is already  defined in an OSHA \nregulation, the Agency stated that it would apply  the same definition here unless this rule were to specify a \ndifferent  definition and solicited comments on whether the phrase \"working  days\" should be defined \ndifferently for purposes of this rule than it  is in Sec.  1903.22(c). All comments received on this issue \nindicated  that the Sec.  1903.22(c) definition was appropriate in this context.  (ID-0203.1; -0205.1; -0213.1.) \nAlthough OSHA is not specifically  incorporating the Sec.  1903.22 definition by reference, the Agency  \nintends to rely on that definition for purposes of enforcing Sec.   1926.1407(e). One commenter sought \nclarification that the two working  day time period would start to run on the first full business day after  the \nrequest for information is received. (ID -0215.1.) This is, in fact,  an accurate representation of ho w this \nprovision will be enforced. If,  for example, the utility receives a request for voltage information on  Monday, \nit will have until the end of the business day on Wednesday to  provide the necessary information.      \nAnother commenter asked OSHA to provide guidance on whether the  voltage information needed to be \nprovided in written form. (ID -0214.1.)  Given the inherent difficulties of obtaining written information  \nexpeditiously in many construction sites, OSHA c oncurs with C -DAC's  recommendation not to require that \nvoltage information be provided in  writing. Paragraph (f) Power Lines Presumed Energized      This \nparagraph requires that employers always assume that all power  lines are energized unless the utilit y \nowner/operator confirms that the  power line has been and continues to be deenergized and visibly  \ngrounded at the worksite. No adverse comments were received on this  provision; it is promulgated as \nproposed. Paragraph (g) Posting of Electrocution Warni ngs     This paragraph requires the posting of \nelectrocution warnings as  follows: one inside the cab in view of the operator and (except for  overhead \ngantry and tower cranes) at least two on the outside of the  equipment. The Committee concluded and OSHA \nagrees that these  electrocution warnings are necessary to protect the operator as well as  any employees \nworking in the area around the crane by increasing their  awareness of the hazard. This provision is similar to \nsec. 5 -3.4.5.2(d)  of ASME B30.5 -2004. No adverse comments were received on this provision;  it is \npromulgated as proposed.",

Under paragraph (m)(4), employer-made equipment must \nmeet the same  criteria specified by Sec. Sec.  1926.1437(m)(1) -(m)(3) for  manufacturer-made equipment. \nIn addition, an employer using equipment  it builds is required to have documents demonstrating that these  \ncriteria have been met. Such documents must be signed by a registered  professional engineer who is a \nqualified person with respect to the  design of the type of equipment involved.      Manufacturers have \nsufficient expertise with respect to the  development of load charts, rated capacities, and related operational  \nlimitations, so there is no need for a documentation requirement for  manufacturer-built floating \ncranes/derricks. However, given the var iety  of employer -made equipment, the Agency included this \ndocumentation  requirement to ensure that employer -made equipment has the same level  of safety as \nmanufactured equipment.     Paragraph (m)(5) addresses structural and access requirements for  the barge, \npontoon, vessel, or other means of flotation. These  requirements are related to the stability of the vessel, \nincluding  minimizing movement while operating equipment, thereby increasing  employee safety by \nreducing the likelihood of capsizing.     Paragraph (m)(5)(i) requires the vessel to be structurally  sufficient \nto withstand the stress of both static and dynamic loads of  the crane/derrick when operating at the \ncrane/derrick's maximum rated  capacity with all planned deck loads and ballasted compartments. This  \nprovision is necessary to minimize the likelihood of the vessel's  structure failing, which would expose \nemployees to a drowning hazard,  or endanger them because of inadvertent movement during equipment  \noperations.     Paragraph (m)(5)(ii) requires a subdivided hull with at least one  longitudinal watertight \nbulkhead to reduce the free surface effect on  the vessel. Subdividing the hull limits the effects of liquid \nmovement  on vessel stability, thereby, reducing the risk of the vessel  capsizing.     Paragraph (m)(5)(iii) \nrequires void compartments to be accessible  for inspection and pumping. This requirement ensures that the \nemployer  evaluates the amount of water in the compartments to determine the  potential free surface \neffect on vessel stability, and then to initiate  pumping when necessary to avoid capsizing.      OSHA \nreceived no comments were received on paragraphs (m)(3)  through (m)(5). OSHA is retaining these provisions \nin the final rule to  ensure the stability of vessels/flotation devices during crane/derrick  operations, thereby \npreventing employee exposure to drowning, impact,  and other hazards as sociated with crane/derrick \noperations onboard  vessels/flotation devices. Paragraph (n) Land Cranes/Derricks     Paragraph (n) of this \nsection sets forth the requirements for land  cranes/derricks when used on a barge, pontoons, vessel or other \nmeans  of flotation. As noted above, land cranes/derricks are not originally  designed for marine use but are \ncovered by this section when they are  mounted on a vessel/flotation device and used on water. The Agency  \ndetermined that special requirements are needed to address the  distinctive safety issues presented when \nusing such equipment.      The stability of the vessel/flotation device is affected by the use  of a land \ncrane/derrick on board. Implementing a system that keeps the  equipment properly located on the vessel is \nessential for maintaining  stability. In addition, land cranes/derricks have less capacity when on  a \nvessel/flotation device than when on land, due to the fact that the  crane/derrick is not originally designed \nfor the special conditions on  a vessel/flotation device. Consequently, the employer must adjust the  rated \ncapacity of the crane/derrick when used on the vessel/flotation  device. If not properly determined, the land \ncrane/derrick may be  overloaded, which can cause loss of stability (including tip -over) and  \nboom/equipment failure, thereby endangering employees.     Paragraph (n)(1) sets forth the requirements \nfor determining the  rated capacity for land cranes/derricks used on a vessel/flotation  device. Load charts \nfor this equipment developed for use on land do not  address the use of the equipment on a flotation device",

Therefore, employers may continue to use  sideboom \ncranes manufactured prior to this date in which the boom is  designed to free fall, except under the conditions \nspecified in Sec .   1926.1426(a)(1). OSHA determines that these conditions will increase  employee safety \ncompared to current practices. No comments were submitted  on this paragraph; it is promulgated as \nproposed.

For example, wrapping a synthetic sling th rough a V-angled  junction point of \nsteel members in a tower mast section can cause the  sling to compress and distort under load, compromising \nits capacity.     As was demonstrated by the March 2008 collapse in New York City,  such protection is \nneeded whenever the object that is in contact with  the sling--whether it is a load or something else, such as \na crane  component used to anchor the sling --has such an edge or configuration.  Therefore, OSHA is \nincluding a requirement in the final Sec.   1926.1404(r)(2) to protect employees from such synthetic slings \nhazards  when used in assembly/disassembly.      OSHA also learned from its investigation of the March \n2008 collapse  that it is vital that synthetic slings be selected and used properly.  In p articular, the sling \nmanufacturer's recommendations must be  observed strictly as the capacity ratings set by the manufacturer \nare  highly dependent on the sling being used as specified by the  manufacturer. (See ID-0336.) Consequently, \nemployers, even with the  assistance of a qualified rigger, will typically not have the ability  to develop safe \nalternative procedures regarding their use. Therefore,  the Agency is including a requirement in the final Sec.   \n1926.1404(r)(3) (also noted in Sec.  1926.1403(b )) that when a  synthetic sling is used during \nassembly/disassembly, the sling  manufacturer's instructions, limitations, specifications and  \nrecommendations must be followed.      Note that Sec.  1926.1403 requires that the employer \"comply \nwith  all applicable manufacturer prohibitions.\" Therefore, if a  manufacturer prohibits the use of synthetic \nslings during assembly/  disassembly, OSHA prohibits that use of such slings. Furthermore, while  Sec.  \n1926.1403 requires the employer to comply with either the  manufacturer's or the employer's \nassembly/disassembly procedures (see  Sec.  1926.1403(a) and (b)), employer procedures may be used only \nif  the employer meets a two-prong test. First, the employer must not be  using synthetic slings. Second, the \nemployer must demonstrate that its  procedures meet the requirements in Sec.  1926.1406.      There may \nbe cases in which the equipment manufacturer does not  prohibit the use of synthetic slings during \nassembly/disassembly, but  identifies wire rope slings in its procedures. In such cases, the  employer may \nonly use synthetic slings if it establishes and implements  its own procedures under Sec.  1926.1403(b) and \ncan demonstrate that  those procedures, including the use of synthetic slings, meet the  criteria \nrequirements in Sec.  1926.1406.      As noted above, several commenters advocated adding a requirement  \nthat rigging be performed by qualified riggers. One local government  stated that although rigging operations \nare critical to completing  crane work, rigging operations involve a high level of risk if not  performed properly. \n(ID-0362.1.) The local government's experience  supports the proposition that human error causes most \nrigging  accidents. (ID-0362.1.) The New York crane collapse and the subsequent  OSHA investigation further \nhighlight the dangers associated with  improper rigging during assembly/disassembly, and the need to address  \nthis hazard was supported by all of the co mmenters who addressed this  issue. OSHA notes that although \nseveral commenters pointed to the need  for qualified riggers early on in the comment process, and again \nduring  the hearing, no one expressed any disagreement about the need to  address the hazard by requiring \nriggers to be qualified. This means of  addressing the hazard is consistent with the means that C-DAC applied  \nwhen it identified a hazard related to rigging in Sec.  1926.1425(c),  and the Agency relies on C -DAC's \nexpertise in selecting th e appropriate  method to address a rigging hazard. OSHA is therefore requiring in  \nSec.  1926.1404(r)(1) that all rigging for crane assembly/disassembly  be performed by a qualified rigger.      \nFinally, the fact that the commenters did not limit their  suggestions on rigging qualifications to rigging \nsynthetic slings leads  the Agency to conclude that all rigging done for assembly/disassembly,  irrespective \nof type, is a safety -critical function.",

(ID-0205.1; -0213.1.)     The provisions in this section for \ntower cranes are not appropriate  for application to a mobile crane configured with a luffing jib. This  \nconclusion is equally applicable to mobile cranes used with tower  attachments. Such attachments typically \nconsist of devices that fix the  mobile crane's main boom at a near-vertical position and use of a  luffing jib. \nOSHA therefore agrees that a mobile crane configured in  either manner should not be treated as a tower \ncrane, since the  supplemental provision for  tower cranes in this section are not  designed for such \napplications.\\132\\ Therefore, the Agency has added  the language suggested by the commenters to the \ndefinition. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\132\\ Note, however, that some \ntower cranes are mobile, i.e.,  truck-mounted (such as truck-mounted self-erecting tower cranes).  These are \nconsidered tower cranes under this standard.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  \nParagraph (a)     Section 1926.1435(a) states that Sec.  1926.1435 contains  supplemental requirements \nfor tower cranes and that all other sections  of this standard apply to tower cranes unless specified otherwise. \nThis  paragraph makes clear that all pro visions of this subpart apply to  tower cranes unless a specific \nprovision states that they are  inapplicable. As discussed below, two sections of this standard that do  not \napply to tower cranes are Sec. Sec.  1926.1415 (safety devices) and  1926.1416 (operational aids). Instead, \nthis section lists the safety  devices and operational aids that are required for tower cranes. In  addition, this \nsection contains additional requirements for erecting,  climbing, dismantling, and inspections that are specific \nto tower  cranes. No comments were received on this paragraph, and it is  promulgated as proposed.  \nParagraph (b) Erecting, Climbing and Dismantling      Section 1926.1435(b)(1) requires the employer t o \ncomply with the  assembly and disassembly requirements set out in Sec. Sec.  1926.1403- 1926.1406, except \nas otherwise specified in this section. Section  1926.1435(b)(1) notes that the industry generally refers to the  \nassembly and disassembly of tower cranes as erecting, climbing and  dismantling. Therefore, when the term \n\"assembly\" is used in  Sec. Sec.  1926.1403 through Sec.  1926.1405, it is replaced with  \"erecting and \nclimbing\" when referring to tower cranes. Similarly,  where the term \"disassembly\" is used, it is replaced with  \n\"dismantling\" when referring to tower cranes.      Section 1926.1435(b)(2), Dangerous areas (self -erecting \ntower  cranes), addresses the hazards associated with crew members located in  certain areas. Employees \nmust not be i n or under the tower, jib, or  rotating portion of the crane during erecting, climbing and \ndismantling  operations until the crane is secured in a locked position and the  competent person indicates \nit is safe to enter these areas. The only  exception to t his is where the manufacturer's instructions direct  \notherwise and the employer limits access to necessary employees only.      These areas are hazardous \nbecause, in the event of unintended  movement of components, there is a heightened chance that an \nemployee  could be struck or crushed. The exception accounts for those situations  in which, due to the \ndesign of the equipment, it is infeasible for all  employees to be out of these areas during erecting, climbing \nand  dismantling operations. No commenters addressed Sec.  1926.1435(b)(2).  It is promulgated without \nchange.     Proposed paragraph (b)(3), Foundations and structural supports,  provided: \"Tower crane \nfoundations and structural supports shall be  designed by the manufacturer or a registered professional \nengineer.\"     When a tower crane is mounted to portions of a structure, it is  vital for safe operation that \nthe structure be able to withstand the  forces imposed by both the crane and the loads the crane will handle \nthroughout  the job.",

One \ntrade association commented that, in many regions of the United  States, employers rely on non -English \nspeakers to operate cranes and  stated that OSHA should require testing organizations to offer crane  \noperator certification in languages other than English. (ID -0231.1.)  OSHA's longstanding position is that \nworkers must be trained and  provided with information in a language that they can understand. That  is \nparticularly important for crane operators, who will be in control  of large pieces of equipment, with th e \npotential to inflict major  damage and injury.     It was C-DAC's intent in the proposed rule, and it is OSHA's \nintent  in this final rule, that non-English speaking operators will have the  ability to become certified using \nlanguages other than English.   Paragraph (h)(2) of the rule, therefore, authorizes testing  organizations to \nadminister tests in any language that the operator  candidate understands. Paragraph (h)(2) is intended to \nensure that  crane operators are certified in a language that they co mprehend, and  that the cranes they \noperate are equipped with the requisite materials  in that language. OSHA intends to work with certifying \norganizations to  ensure that examinations in appropriate languages are available within  the four-year \nphase-in p eriod under this section.      OSHA expects employers who perform their own testing under  \nparagraph (c) to test candidates in the languages understood by their  workers. OSHA concludes that \naccredited testing organizations providing  certifications under paragraph (b) should likewise provide testing \nin  major languages understood by the relevant worker population of the  regions in which they do business. \nDoing so will maximize an  organization's share of the testing market. Moreover, OSHA expects that  \nemployers who rely on testing organizations will demand testing in the  languages understood by their \nworkforces. Paragraph (i) [Reserved.] Paragraph (j) Certification Criteria     Paragraph (j) of this section sets \nout the qualification and  certification criteria applicable to Options (1), (2), and (4) of this  section. These \ncriteria address the knowledge and skills that are  fundamental to safe crane operation. As stated in the \nintroductory  language in Sec.  1926.1427(j), these would  constitute \"minimum\"  criteria; the accredited \ntesting organizations, employers, or local or  State licensing offices would not be precluded from adding \nadditional  requirements to their certification or qualification programs.     Paragraph (j)(1) describes the \ncriteria that must be covered by the  written examination portion of a qualification/certification program.  As \nstated above in the discussion of examination administration, the  written portion of the examination may be \nadministered orally, so long  as the candidate has demonstrated sufficient literacy relevant to the  work (e.g., \nload charts and equipment manual).      Paragraph (j)(1)(i) states that the individual seeking  qualification \nor certification must know \"the information necessary  for safe operation of the specific type of equipment \nthe individual  will operate * * *\" Paragraph (j)(1)(i) goes on to list specific types  of information the individual \nmust know.      Paragraph (j)(1)(i)(A) requires that the written examination  address the ca ndidate's \nknowledge of the equipment controls and  operational/performance characteristics of the specific type of  \nequipment. Operational/performance characteristics would include, for  example, the deflection \ncharacteristics of the boom, including how  deflection affects the positioning of the load and the extent to",

In such a situation employers, though, would  be precluded from using such a person \nif other types of signals were to  be used. No co mments were received on this provision; it is promulgated  \nas proposed.     Paragraph (c)(5) of this section would require that the signal  person pass knowledge and \npractical tests to demonstrate that he or she  meets the qualification requirements. The knowledge test may \nbe either  oral or written. C-DAC noted that signal persons normally need not read  or write to perform their \njobs effectively. No comments were received  on this provision. Therefore, OSHA agrees with C -DAC that \nadministering  the knowledge test orally, without a separate demonstration of  literacy, should be permitted. \nThe provision is promulgated as  proposed, with one minor grammatical correction.  Section 1926.1429 \nQualifications of Maintenance and Repair Workers      This section addre sses the qualifications that the \nworkers who  maintain and repair cranes/derricks must possess. Subpart N of this  part at former Sec.  \n1926.550 contained no provisions concerning the  qualifications of maintenance and repair workers.     The \nCommittee had two basic concerns regarding maintenance and  repair work. First, it was aware of accidents \nthat had occurred when  the equipment that was being maintained or repaired was operated  improperly. \nFor example, a maintenance worker who booms down a mobile  hydraulic crane to one side without following \nthe manufacturer's  instructions for deploying outriggers may overturn the equipment. C -DAC  concluded \nthat placing restrictions on equipment operations during such  work would help prevent such accidents.      \nSecond, the Committee sought to avoid hazards that can result from  maintenance and repair work that is \ndone improperly by ensuring that  maintenance and repair workers are sufficiently qualified to perform  \ntheir work. For example, if a load-bearing component is removed for  maintenance or repair and re-installed \nincorrectly, unintended movement  of the load or even a collapse could occur du ring operations. Paragraph \n(a)     The Committee was aware that maintenance and repair workers  sometimes need to operate \nequipment to perform maintenance, inspect the  equipment, or verify the performance of the equipment. \nThis work  typically involves operating the equipment to get access to components,  diagnose problems and \ncheck repairs.     C-DAC did not determine it necessary for maintenance, inspection  and repair personnel \nto meet the requirements in proposed Sec.   1926.1427, Operator qualificatio n and certification, when \noperating  equipment for such purposes. The operations involved for these purposes  are almost always \ndone without a load on the hook. The only instance  when there is a load on the hook is if the equipment is \nload tested.  However, even when load testing, the operation is very limited, since  the load is not moved \nabout as it would be during normal crane  operations.     While such limited operation does not, in C-DAC's \nview, necessitate  the maintenance, inspection or repair personnel to meet the proposed  Sec.  1926.1427 \nrequirements, a failure to operate the equipment  properly even in these limited circumstances can result in \naccidents  from, for example, unintended movement or tip-over. OSHA agrees, and is  therefore permitting \nmaintenance and repair workers to operate  equipment during their work only under specific restrictions \ndesigned  to ensure safety.     Specifically, under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, maintenance  and repair \nworkers are permitted to operate the equipment only to the  extent necessary to perform maintenance, \ninspect the equipment, or  verify its performance. Under this provision, maintenance and repair  workers are \nnot permitted to operate the equipment during regular  operations.     Paragraph (a)(2) of this section \nrequires the maintenance and  repair worker who operates equipment to either (i) do so under the  direct \nsupervision of an operator who meets the requirements of Sec.   1926.1427, Operator qualification and \ncertification, or (ii) be  familiar with the operation, limitations, characteristics and hazards  associated with \nthe type of equipment involved.  Paragraph (b)     In light of the safety hazards that could result from",

Cranes and derricks used in   construction had been regulated by Sec.  \n1926.550. Accordingly, Sec.   1926.550 has been redesignated and reserved.  Section 1926.1400 Scope      \nAs explained in the proposed rule, C -DAC decided to describe the  scope of the rule with both a functional \ndescription (\"power-operated  equipment used in construction that can hoist, lower, and horizontally  move \na suspended load\") together with a non-exclusive list of the  types of existing equipment that are covered.\\3\\ \nBy defining the scope  in this way, C-DAC tried to provide the clearest possible notice as to  the equipment \nthat is covered by the standard while also including new  and/or other existing equipment that is similar to \nthe listed examples.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\3\\ The scope of the \nstandard with respect to some of the listed  equipment is further delineated in th e section of the standard \nthat  specifically relates to that equipment (for example, Sec.   1926.1436, Derricks and Sec.  1926.1438,",

For  example, the boom, when fully assembled on the ground, may be more than  20 feet from \na power line. However, when raising it from the ground, it  may get closer than 20 feet. Accordingly, under this \nlanguage, the  \"direction\" that the boom will travel as it is raised must also be  evaluated for proximity to \npower lines.      Another example is the assembly of a tower crane. As tower sections  are added, the \nassembly process may reach a point where components are  closer to power lines than when the process \nbegan. That \"direction\"  of assembly upwards must also be evaluated.      If an employer determines that \nthe 20 foot \"trigger\"  determination is positive, then the employer is required to take  additional steps. \nSpecifically, the employer must meet the requirements  under either Option (1), Option (2), or Option (3) of \nSec.   1926.1407(a).\\25\\ Some commenters were concerned that the three  compliance options in Sec.  \n1926.1407(a) could be constru ed as a  prioritization of compliance preferences, e.g., a preference for  \ndeenergization over the other options. (ID -0203.1; -0214.1.) In  response, OSHA wishes to clarify that the \nthree options are in no  particular order. In the Agency's view they repre sent three adequately  protective \ncompliance methods. The standard offers employers the  flexibility to select the method most suitable for \neach specific work  situation. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\25\\ If no part \nof the crane, load or load line could come  closer than 20 feet to a power line, the employer is not required to  \ntake any further action under this section. However, the employer  may encounter a situation where it needs \nto get closer than  anticipated to the power lines during the assembly/disassembly  process. In such a case \nthe employer is required to go back and  conduct a new 20 foot \"trigger assessment.\" ------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------  Paragraph (a)(1) Option (1)     An employer choosing Option (1) of this \nsection will protect  against electrocution by having the power lines deenergized and visibly  grounded. \nWhere the employer elects this option, it will not have to  implement any of the encroachment/electrocution \nprevention measures  listed in Sec.  1926.1407(b). This option helps to minimize the  electrical hazards \nposed by power lines.\\26\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\26\\ Grounding the \nlines helps minimize the electrical hazard  from possible reenergizing of the lines; however, some voltage will  \nstill appear on the line until the circuit protective devices open  the circuit. In addition, under certain \nconditions, the circuit  protective devices will not open the line, and the voltage will  remain. -------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------      A number of commenters confirmed the Committee's \ndetermination that  because of the time and cost considerations in arranging for the  utility owner/operator \n\\27\\ to deenergize and ground the line,  deenergizing and grounding has not been routinely done. (ID-0155; - \n0203; see the discussion in the proposed rule preamble of deenergizing  and grounding with regard to \nproposed Sec.  1926.1408(a)(2)(i), 73 FR  59755, Oct. 9, 2008.) -----------------------------------------------------------\n----------------      \\27\\ OSHA n otes that the phrase \"utility owner/operator\"  reflects scenarios where \nutilities may not be operated by an owner  but by some entity other than the owner. Therefore wherever the  \nphrase \"utility owner/operator\" is used in the standard or in the  preamble it is meant to apply to utility \nowners or utility  operators. The final rule also uses the word \"utility\" in its  broadest sense. It includes \ntraditional utilities as well as other  entities (such as steel or paper companies) that own or operate the  \npower lines. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      Therefore, OSHA continues to \nconclude that providing other safe and  practical options in the final rule will help to reduce unsafe  practices \nin the industry. Those other options (Options (2) and (3) in  Sec.  1926.1407(a)) combined with Sec.  \n1926.1407(b) are designed to be  effective protection against the hazards of ele ctrocution.     One",

Paragraphs (a) through (j) of this section provide inspection  requirements for equipment covered \nby subpart CC. Those requirements  are supplemented by other sections of this standard for specific types  \nof equipment. This section is structured  so that certain activities  (e.g., equipment modification, \nrepair/adjustment, assembly, severe  service, or equipment not in regular use) and the passage of time  (e.g., \nshift, monthly, and annual/comprehensive) trigger the inspection  requirements.     The proposed rule \nspecified that the various inspections were to be  conducted by either a \"competent person\" or a \"qualified \nperson\"  depending on the type of inspection. Both terms are defined in Sec.   1926.01. OSHA solicited \npublic comment on wheth er a protocol similar to  that for signal person qualifications in Sec.  1926.28 is \nneeded to  ensure that the person who performs these inspections has the requisite  level of expertise (73 \nFR 59766, Oct. 9, 2008). Section 1926.28  establishes qualification requirements for signal persons and \nrequires  those individuals to have their qualifications evaluated by a qualified  evaluator to act as signal \npersons under this subpart.      Several commenters responded that there should be a verified  testing \nsystem to ensure \"qualified inspectors\" have the requisite  knowledge to inspect effectively or that the \nstandard require  inspectors to demonstrate that ability. (ID -0182.1; -0187.1; -0226.)     Regarding \nparagraph (f) of this section (annual/comprehensive  inspections of equipment) and Sec.  1926.1413(c) \n(annual wire rope  inspections), a local government further recommended that OSHA require  that a \ngovernment agency or a third party crane inspector licensed or  certified by the local government perform the \nannual inspection. (ID- 0156.1.) The commenter also believed that the individual who inspects  an equipment \nmodification in accordance with paragraph (a) of this  section must possess a certification from the \nmanufacturer or an  independent third party and have the requisite training to inspect  modified, repaired, \nor altered crane components.     In contrast, a utility company and two trade associations did not  support \nrevising the final rule to include a more stringent inspector  qualification requirement. (ID-0226; -0205.1; -\n0213.) The two trade  associations expressed concerns that the Committee never discussed the  required \nlevel of knowledge of inspection workers, which, in the  commenter's view, means that consensus was not \nreached on the issue and  that the issue should not be included in the final rule.      In response to these \ncomments, OSHA is retaining the qualification  requirements for inspectors as specified in the proposed rule \nbut is  not mandating that the inspector be assessed by a qualified evaluator,  certified, or licensed because \nthere is not sufficient evidence in the  record to warrant these additional requirements. A number of current  \nOSHA construction standard s, as did former Sec.  1926.550, require  inspections to be conducted by \ncompetent persons or qualified persons.  For example, Sec.  1926.651(k) requires that a competent person \nconduct  a daily inspection of excavations for possible cave-in hazards. OSHA is  not aware of evidence in the \nrecord indicating that accidents would be  prevented if OSHA required inspectors to have additional \nqualifications  or credentials. OSHA disagrees, and concludes that accidents do not  occur due to the inability \nof competent or qualified persons to conduct  adequate inspections of cranes under the former standard. \nAccordingly,  OSHA is retaining the requirement in Sec.  1926.1412 that the various  required inspections \nbe conducted either by competent persons or  qualified persons.     The local government's request that \nOSHA not preempt local laws and  allow local governments to continue to play a role in crane inspections  is \nwithin the scope of the local government's broader preemption  concerns addressed in the discussion of \nfederalism in section V.D of  this preamble. However, OSHA notes that Sec.  1926.1412 would not  preclude \nlocal government inspectors or others who are not employees of  the employer responsible for the inspections, \nfrom serving as  inspectors in compliance with the requirements of this standard. The  inspector need only",

Sec.  1926.1416(e) and 1926.1435(e)(6), a load weight/  capacity \ndevice is a category II operational aid and, as such, it must  be repaired within 30 days if it is not working \nproperly.     OSHA requested comment on whether to apply that same 30-day  requirement, along with the \nexception for a situation in which a part  is ordered within 7 days of the malfunction but is not received in \ntime  to complete the repair within 30 days.     Several commenters supported a revision of paragraph (f)(3) \nof this  section to include the recommended time limits. (ID -0205.1; -0213.1; - 0343.) OSHA concludes it is \nreasonable to make this revision for  consistency with alternatives that are available to crane users during  \nthe repair of similar operational aids . Section 1926.1436(f)(3) has  been revised to reflect this modification. \nParagraph (g) Post-Assembly Approval and Testing --New or Reinstalled  Derricks     Paragraph (g) of this \nsection lists the minimum testing and  approval requirements that an employer must meet to assure that its  \nderrick will be structurally and functionally able to perform within  the manufacturer's specifications and \nrecommendations.

Also, equipment with \nlattice/cable supported booms has different  deflection characteristics than equipment with non -lattice \nbooms (that  is, hydraulic ram extensible booms).     Paragraph (j)(1)(i)(B) requires the candidate to know \nthe use of,  and be able to calculate (manually or with the use of a calculator),  load/capacity information on \na variety of configurations of the  equipment. Such information is typically contained in load charts and  \nmanuals. This provision ensures tha t the operator is able to accurately  determine, independently, the \ncapacity of the equipment in each  situation that he/she might encounter and thereby avoid overloading the  \nequipment.     Paragraph (j)(1)(i)(C) requires the candidate to know procedures  for preventing and \nresponding to power line contact. As discussed above  in relation to Sec. Sec.  1926.1407 -1926.1411, \nelectrical contact with  power lines is one of the principal causes of crane-related fatalities  and injuries, and \nthose sections contain detailed requirements for  preventing such contact and for reducing the likelihood of \ndeath or  injury should such contact occur.\\120\\ Knowing how to prevent and  respond to power line contact \nis therefore critical knowledge for any  crane operator. -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n----      \\120\\ As provided in Sec.  1926.1408(g)(1)(i)(A) on power line  safety, operators must be aware of \nthe danger of electrocution if  they simultaneously touch energized equipment and the ground. They  must \nalso, pursuant to Sec.  1926.1408(g)(1)(i)(B), be trained to  understand that when the equipment makes \nelectrical contact with a  power line, the operator's safety requires him or her  to remain  inside the cab \nexcept where there is an imminent danger of fire,  explosion, or other emergency that necessitates their \nleaving the  cab. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      Paragraph (j)(1)(i)(D) \naddresses the need for crane operators to  have technical knowledge similar to the subject matter listed in  \nAppendix C applicable to the specific type of equipment the individual  will operate. These criteria were \nselected by C-DAC because, in the  experience of the committee's members, they are critical knowledge and  \nskill areas for equipment operators. OSHA defers to C -DAC's experience  on this issue and notes that the \nAgency did not receive any comments  suggesting that a particular item be removed from this list. While  \ntesting based on the specific list provided in Appendix C is not the  means of satisfying the requirements of \nSec.  1926.1427(j)(1)(i)(D),  alternative criteria must be \"similar to\" that of Appendix C. The  appendix also \nserves as a \"safe harbor,\" meaning that testing on all  of the criteria provided in Appendix C would satisfy the \nrequirements  of Sec.  1926.1427(j)(1)(i)(D).      In addition to the technical knowledge that is required \nunder Sec.   1926.1427(j)(1)(i)(D), technical knowledg e applicable to three specific  subjects is required \nunder Sec.  1926.1427(j)(1)(i)(E). Paragraph  (j)(1)(i)(E)(1) requires that an operator have technical \nknowledge  about the suitability of the supporting ground and surface to handle  expected loads. Paragraph \n(j)(1)(i)(E)(2) requires operators to possess  technical knowledge applicable to site hazards, such as hazards \nposed  by excavations or vehicular traffic. Paragraph (j)(1)(i)(E)(3) requires  operators to have technical \nknowledge about site access so that the  operator can evaluate whether conditions at the point of access to \nthe  site enable the equipment to travel safely onto or off of the site. For  example, where equipment must \ndescend or ascend a dirt ramp, the  operator needs to be able to assess the effect of the ramp's steepness  \nand to detect signs of instability.      Paragraph (j)(1)(i)(F) requires operators to de monstrate a thorough  \nknowledge of this subpart, including incorporated materials. Operators  play a key role in the application of \nthese requirements, and it is  therefore essential that they understand them.",

Paragraphs (g) and (h)      \nUnder paragraph (g) of this section, the employer must implement  the procedures developed in accordance \nwith Sec.  1926.1410(d). And  under paragraph (h) of this section, the utility owner/operator (or  registered \nprofessional engineer) and all employers of the employees  involved in the work must identify one person \nwho will direct the  implementation of the procedures. This person must direct the  implementation of the \nprocedures and have the au thority to stop work at  any time to ensure safety. As with paragraph (f) of this \nsection, OSHA  is adding a reference to the registered professional engineer to  paragraph (h) to ensure that \nthe entity that helped develop the  procedures participate in the decision required under paragraph (h).      \nThe Committee concluded that, in view of the fact that more than  one employer is typically involved in these \nsituations, coordination  among the employers of these employees is needed for the protective  measures \nto be effectively implemented. Once the operation is underway,  safety-related orders typically need to be \ngiven and followed without delay.  Since an employee of one employer typically would not immediately follow \nan  instruction from another employer, it is necessary that, before these  operations begin, all employees \nunderstand that the one designated person  will have this authority. For these reasons, the Co mmittee \ndetermined that  there needs to be one person who all involved in the operation recognize  as having this \nrole and authority.     A commenter objected to having the utility owner/operator involved  in determining \nwhich individual should direct impl ementation of the  procedures, saying that the decision should be made \nby the contractors.  (ID-0155.1.) OSHA notes that this provision is closely tied to  paragraphs (d) and (f) of \nthis section, under which the utility owner/  operator or registered profes sional engineer is involved in \ndeveloping  the procedures and in reviewing the procedures with the appropriate  employees. At this point, \nthe utility or registered professional  engineer is well situated to help identify an individual who is able to  \ndirect the implementation of the procedures. As with the other  provisions of this section that require the \ninvolvement of the utility  or a registered professional engineer, the utility has the discretion  not to \nparticipate, in which case the employer operating the equipment  must use a registered professional engineer. \nParagraph (i) [Reserved] Paragraph (j)     This provision requires the employer to safely stop operations if a  \nproblem occurs with implementing the procedures in paragraph (d) of  this section or if there is an indication \nthat those procedures are  inadequate to prevent electrocution. In addition, this provision  requires that the \nemployer either develop new proced ures which comply  with paragraph (d) or contact the utility \nowner/operator and have them  deenergize and visibly ground or relocate the power line(s) before  \nresuming operations.     Two commenters suggested that the utility might not be able to  deenergize the \nlines for medical or security reasons and asked what  would happen in such a case. (ID-0155.1; -0162.1.) OSHA \nrecognizes that  utilities may not be willing or able to discontinue power to their  customers, and Sec.  \n1926.1410(j) permits relocating t he line as an  alternative to deenergizing.      An electric utility \nrepresentative requested that OSHA clarify  which employer has the responsibility to comply with this \nprovision,  stating it should be the equipment operator and not the utility owner/ operator. (ID-0161.1.) OSHA \nnotes that this paragraph's requirement for  the employer to \"safely stop operations\" applies to the \nemployer(s)  who are conducting the operation, and the requirement for that employer  to contact the utility \nowner/operator after stopping operations makes  clear that a utility owner/operator who is not conducting \nequipment  operations near the power line is not the \"employer\" under this  paragraph. OSHA concludes \nthese points are sufficiently clear, and the  provision is promulgate d as proposed.  Paragraph (k)      \nProposed paragraph (k) required that, where a device originally  designed by the manufacturer for use as a",

The Committee determined that slope, compaction and firmness  \nare the key factors that are involved in the ability of the ground to  support the equipment.     \"Supporting \nmaterials\" is defined as meaning blocking, mats,  cribbing, marsh buggies (in marshes/wetlands), or similar \nsupporting  materials or devices. Such materials typically help to distribute the  load of the crane over a \nbroad area and/or assist in leveling the  equipment. The list in the definition of examples of such materials is  \nnonexclusive--it includes similar materials and devices that would  serve the same purpose(s).     The one \ncomment that was received that referenced this provision is  addressed in the discussion below of Sec.  \n1926.1402(b). (See ID - 0178.1.) Paragraph (b)     Under paragraph (b) of this section, the equipment is \nprohibited  from being assembled or used \\10\\ unless ground conditions are firm,  drained, and graded to a \nsufficient extent so that, in conjunction (if  necessary) with the use of supporting materials, the equipment",

As discussed \nin the preamble to the proposed rule, paragraphs  (e)(2)(i)-(iv) use the phrase \"operating design factor.\"  \n\"Operating\" is included to show that the factors specified in these  provisions are to reflect how the rop e is \ninstalled on the specific  piece of equipment in which it is used. In other words, the operating  design factor \nis calculated based on numerous considerations associated  with both the rope's design and how it is installed \non the equipment.     The prohibition on the use of rotation resistant rope for duty  cycle and repetitive \nlifts does not apply to Type I rope because the  Committee determined that such rope is significa ntly more \nresistant to  rotation or torque compared with Types II and III. This reduces Type  I's potential for internal \nwear during use and moves degradation from  the inner wires to the outer wires, where damage is more easily  \ndetected during wire rope inspections. Accordingly, the Committee  concluded that Type I rope can safely be \nused for duty cycle and  repetitive lifts at an operating design factor below 5 (but no less  than 3.5), as \nspecified in proposed paragraph (c)(2)(ii). No comments  addressed the distinction between the types of wire \nrope in paragraph  (e)(2)(i) of this section.     In the proposed rule, OSHA noted that C-DAC did not include  \ndefinitions for \"duty cycle\" or \"repetitive lifts.\" The Agency  asked for comment on whether definitio ns of \nthese terms should be  included in Sec.  1926.1401 and proposed definitions that it determined  were \nconsistent with C-DAC's understanding and widely understood in the  industry. OSHA proposed to define \"duty \ncycle\" as \"a continuous  operation in which approximately the same type and weight of load is  handled.\" It \ngave dredging with a clamshell as an example of duty  cycle work. OSHA proposed to define \"repetitive lifts\" \nas \"a  continuous operation with loads that may vary in size and weight.\" For  an example, it noted that steel \nerection work typically involves  repetitive lifts of various size and configurations of structural steel  members.     \nThree commenters agreed that \"duty cycle\" and \"repetitive  lifts\" should be defined, and no commenters \nsuggested otherwise. (ID- 0205.1; -0213.1; -0226.) The commenters on the subject did not object  to OSHA's \nproposed definition of \"repetitive lifts,\" but two  recommended that OSHA's proposed definition of \"duty \ncycle\" be  replaced with the following:       A type of crane service in which bulk material is transferred  \nfrom one point to another by rapidly lifting, swinging, booming, and  placing the material. Typical types of \nduty cycle service are  dragline, clamshell, grapple, and magnet. This type of service is  differentiated from \nstandard crane \"lift service\" in that cycle  times are very short and continuous, often less than 1 minute per  \nload, and loads are lifted and placed in general areas rather than  precise positions to permit such rapid cycles.  \n(ID-0205.1; -0213.1.)     OSHA determines that in most respects the commenters' suggested  definition is \nclearer and better reflects the intent of the Agency.  Therefore, OSHA is adopting their definition with on ly \nminor  modification (the reference to \"lifting, swinging, booming and  placing\" is not necessary, since those \nactions simply describe typical  crane movements). OSHA is therefore adopting a slightly modified  version \nof the definition suggested by the commenters. This definition  is being included in Sec.  1926.1401, as is the \ndefinition for  \"repetitive lifts\" proposed by OSHA and quoted above.  Paragraph (e)(3)     This proposed \nparagraph specified additional requirements that must  be met when Types II  and III rotation resistant wire \nrope are used with  an operating design factor of between 3.5 and 5 (for non-duty cycle,  non-repetitive lifts). \nThe Committee concluded that these additional  requirements are needed to ensure that use of such ropes \nwould be safe.     Due to renumbering, proposed paragraph (c)(3) corresponds to final  paragraph (e)(3).",

Sec.  1926.1437(n)(5)(i) through (iv). The  Agency notes that this definition differs from \nthe term \"positively  secured\" in subpart N in former Sec.  1926.550(f)(1)(iv), which  required that \"mobile \ncranes on barges shall be positively  secured.\" As OSHA stated in a letter of interpretation, the te rm  \n\"positively secured\" in the subpart N means \"physically  attached\"--similar to the type of system described in \nOption (1) of  paragraph (n)(5)(i). (See OSHA's interpretation letter to Mr. Gary  C. Hay, October 12, 2004 (ID-\n0014).) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      Paragraphs (n)(5)(i) through (iv) \nprovide the four options for  securing the land crane/derrick to the vessel/flotation device. The  options for \npreventing equipment shifting include direct physic al  attachment, corralling, a rail system or a centerline \ncable system.  These options serve to prevent inadvertent movement of the equipment  away from its \nproper location on the vessel/flotation device, which can  harm employees working nearby, or such \nmovement can endanger employees  by capsizing the vessel. However, it is not the purpose of these  options \nto prevent any portion of the land crane/derrick from pulling  vertically up from the deck when handling loads \nbeyond the land crane/ derrick's rated capacity. Rather, these options will prevent horizontal  rolling or shifting \naway from the land crane/derrick's proper location.     Paragraph (n)(5)(v) requires that the option selected \nfor securing  the equipment on the vessel be designed by a marine eng ineer, a  registered professional \nengineer familiar with floating crane/derrick  design, or a qualified person familiar with floating crane/derrick  \ndesign. The Agency determined that expertise in floating crane/derrick  design is necessary to design a \nsecuring system that meets the selected  option's requirements and to prevent inadvertent movement of the  \nequipment on the vessel/flotation device.      OSHA received no comments on any of the requirements in \nproposed  paragraph (n)(5). Consequently, OSHA is retaining this paragraph in the  final rule because \nproperly securing land crane/derrick on the vessel/  flotation device will maintain the stability of the \nvessel/flotation  device, thereby preventing the vessel/flotation  device from capsizing  and endangering \nemployees.     Paragraph (n)(6) \\140\\ provides an exception stating that an  employer does not have to \nsecure mobile auxiliary cranes as required by  paragraph (n)(5) when the employer demonstrates that specific  \nconditions have been met. Typically, the movement of the mobile crane  on these vessels does not adversely \naffect the stability of the  floating crane/derrick because of the large size, displacement and  design of the \nfloating crane/derrick. The size and desi gn of the  floating crane/derrick also makes it less susceptible than \nother  vessels to the effects of wind, waves, and other environmental  conditions. OSHA finds that when the \nemployer demonstrates meeting the  criteria specified by Sec. Sec.  1926.1437( n)(6)(v) and (vi), employees  \nwill receive adequate protection from inadvertent horizontal movement  of a mobile crane located on the \ndeck of a floating crane/derrick.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\140\\ \nFormerly paragraph (n)(5)(vi) in the proposed rule.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \nUnder paragraph (n)(6)(i), a written plan that is developed and  signed by a marine engineer, or a registered \nprofessional engineer  familiar with floating crane/derrick design, is required. OSHA finds  that developing a \nwritten plan for the use of these cranes requires  specialized knowledge and skill because of the catastrophic  \nconsequences to employees that could result if the task is not  performed correctly.     Paragraph (n)(6)(ii), \nrequires that the written plan be developed  so that the applicable requirements of Sec.  1926.1437 are met \ndespite  the position, travel, operation, and lack of physical attachment,  corralling, use of rails, or use of \ncable system of the mobile  auxiliary crane.

Internal Revenue Service, Source Book, \nprofit rates over 2000-2006.     In the extreme, if demand is perfectly inelastic (i.e., the price  elasticity is \n0), then the expected impact of compliance costs equal to  1 percent of revenues would be a 1 percent \nincrease in the price of the  product or service, with no decline in demand or profit. Such a  situation would \nbe most likely when there are few, if any, substitutes  for the product or service offered by the affected sector \nor if the  products or services of the affected sector account only for a small  portion of the income of its \nconsumers. On the other hand, if demand is  perfectly elastic (i.e., the price elasticity is infinitely large),  then \nno increase in price is possible, and before-tax profits would be  reduced by an amount equal to the costs of \ncompliance (minus any cost  savings resulting from compliance, such as improved worker health and  \nreduced insurance costs). Under this scenario, if the costs of  compliance represent a large percentage of the \nsector's profits, some  establishments might be forced to close. This scenario is highly  unlikely to occur, \nhowever, because it can only arise when there are  other goods and services that are, in the eye of the \nconsumer, perfect  substitutes for the goods and services the affected establishments  produce or provide.     \nA common intermediate case would be a price elasticity of one. In  this situation, if the costs of compliance \namount to 1 percent of  revenues, then production would decline by 1 percent and prices would  rise by 1 \npercent. The sector would be expected to remain in business  and maintain a comparable profit rate as before \nimplementation of the  standard, but would produce 1 percent less of its services. Consumers  would \neffectively absorb the costs through a combination of increased  prices and reduced consumption; this, as the \ncourt described in ADA v.  Secretary of Labor, is the more typical case.     Table B-12 presents estimates for \nthe number of affected  establishments, average establishment revenues and profits, and average  \nestablishment costs for each affected industry s ector. Economic impacts  in the table (the two right -most \ncolumns) are represented by two  ratios: Of average establishment costs to revenues, and of costs to  profits.     \nThe average (unweighted) cost of the final standard per  establishment is about $560 annually. As is evident \nfrom the data and  estimates in Table B-12, average establishment costs of compliance for  the final standard \nare not large in relation to the corresponding  average establishment revenues and profits in each of the \nindustry  sectors. The estimated per establishment cost of compliance represents  less than 0.2 percent (or \n0.002) of average establishment revenues for  all affected sectors. In most sectors it is lower. The average cost \nas  a percentage of revenues across all sectors is 0.05 percent (0.0005).     The impact of the final standard \nmeasured by the ratio of costs to  profits varies across the affected sectors. Among the sectors in the  Crane \nLessees sector, which includes about 163,000 of the 267,000  affected establishments; in this sector, \nemployers, on average, are  expected to have costs that represent about 1 percent of profits.  Within the \nsector of employers Own but Do Not Rent, affected  establishments in 14 of the 46 sectors have average costs \nas a percent  of profits of 1 percent or higher (from 1 to 3 percent); this impact of  costs as a percentage of \nprofits is relatively low.     In the two sectors that are most intensively involved in crane use,  Crane Rental \nwith Operators (employers primarily in the crane rental  business) and Crane Rental without Operators (bare \nrentals), estimated  costs are about 2 percent of profits. In the Own and Rent Cranes with  Operators sectors, \ncosts as a percentage of profits are estimated at  about 4 percent. Because these employers both own and",

Ultimately, C-DAC  included the 2,000 pound cutoff to parallel ANSI B30.5 \nin this regard  (see 73 FR 59841, Oct. 9, 2008).      The rulemaking record shows that many of the same \nhazards presented  by larger cranes are present for cranes in this capacity range,  including operating in \nproximity to power lines, the potential for  collapse if the crane is overloaded, and the need for adequate \nground  conditions to ensure the crane's stability during operation. As a labor  representative testified, these \nsmaller cranes may be used in tight  spaces where larger cranes cannot be used. An operator's loss of  control \nof the load in a tight space would present a serious safety  hazard, and the potential for operating in tight \nspaces highlights the  need for operators of even relatively low -capacity cranes to be highly  skilled.     \nOSHA also rejects the suggestions by some commenters that  exemptions should be created for cranes that \nare typically used for  repetitive, predictable, intermittent, or light use.     The principal difficulty with this \nsuggestion is that the  underlying causes of crane -related fatalities and injuries are not  necessarily \ndiminished in such situations. For example, the presence of  power lines presents an electrocution hazard in \nall situations,  irrespective of how the equipment is used. Proper ground conditions,  which can change \nduring crane use, are also as necessary for those  types of uses as others, and all cranes can be overloaded if \noperated  improperly. The knowledge and skill needed for attaining operator  qualification/certification \nunder this section is a prerequisite for  being able to successfully address these and other hazards.      \nFurthermore, while an employer may in itially plan to use a crane in  a repetitive or otherwise predictable \nmanner, or to handle light loads,  unforeseen circumstances can arise that can alter those plans. Wind,  \nwhich can arise unexpectedly during a lift, can dramatically decrease  the capacity of a crane and increase the \ndifficulty in properly  handling the load; a previously \"repetitive\" lift can change  unexpectedly when rain \ncauses the ground supporting the crane to become  muddy and less able to support the crane; a rigging \nproblem may arise  during one of the \"repetitive\" lifts, which could cause unexpected  load control problems \nduring the lift; and hoisting a \"light\" load at  a low boom angle can pose similar overturning hazards to hoisting \na  heavy load at a high boom angle. Nor are th ere fewer crane-related  hazards when a worker operates a \ncrane only intermittently. For  example, that operator on one of those occasions may have to run the  crane \nnear power lines, in the blind, with uneven winds, or at a low  boom angle; in such cases (as in many others) \nhe/she needs to be as  fully capable as an operator who runs the crane regularly. Paragraph (a)(4)     The \nAgency is adding this paragraph to the final rule to clarify  that operator certification or qualification as \nrequired under this  section must be provided at no cost to employees who are already  employed by the \nemployer on November 8, 2010. This clarification is  consistent with the Agency's revision of the training \nrequirements  throughout subpart CC to expressly state that employers must provide  all training at no cost \nto employees. The clarification is consistent  with the Agency's treatment of costs for operat or qualification \nand  certification in the preliminary economic analysis provided in the preamble  of the proposed rule. (See, \ne.g., 73 FR 59895, Oct. 9, 2008 (operator  certification training treated as cost to employer).)     Based on \nthe testimony of several witnesses at the hearing, OSHA  concludes that imposing the operator qualification \nand certification  costs on the employer will not be overly burdensome to the employer. At  the hearing, a \nrepresentative from a crane rental company said that,  although his company incurs additional cost to provide \ncertification,  his company considers that cost an investment in the safety of their  employees. (ID-0344.) An \ninsurance company representative and former  crane operator stated that the cost of certification was modest \nwhen  compared to the cost of accidents. (ID-0343.) This witness also stated  that his company believes that \nemployers who certify their operators  have fewer accidents and that, as a result, his firm offers companies",

Any delivery activities not excluded under paragraphs (c)(17)(i)  and (ii) are subject \nto the standard. However, to avoid any possible  ambiguity on this point, OSHA has included paragraph \n(c)(17)(iii).  Paragraphs (c)(17)(iii)(A) -(C) list explicit activities for which the  exclusion does not apply. \nParagraph (c)(17 )(iii)(D) is included to  avoid any possible implication that paragraphs (c)(17)(iii)(A) -(C)  \nrepresent an exclusive list of delivery activities that are subject to  the final rule. Paragraph (d)     Paragraph \n(d) of this section is included because there are some  types of equipment for which only limited requirements \napply, and  others where there are special requirements that supplement, rather  than displace, the other \nrequirements in the rule. To avoid confusion,  this paragraph establishes that all parts of the rule apply unless \na  provision specifically identifies other parts of the rule as  inapplicable, or identifies the only provisions of \nthe standard that  are applicable. No comments were received on this paragraph, and it is  promulgated as \nproposed except that \"subpart CC\" replaces the phrase  \"this standard\" from the proposed rule. Paragraph (e)     \nProposed paragraph (e) of this section provided that the duties of  controlling entities \\8\\ are not limited to \nthe duties specified in  Sec. Sec.  1926.1402(c), 1926.1402(e) and 1926.1424(b). The paragraphs  \nreferenced in this provision listed specific duties imposed on  controlling entities under this rule.      \nParagraph (e) was included to avoid any implication that the listing of  certain duties placed on controlling \nentities by this rule displaces  the duties placed on them under OSHA's multi-employer policy. -------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------      \\8\\ The definition of \"controlling entity\" is explained in the  \ndiscussion of Sec.  1926.1402(c).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      Several \ncommenters questioned OSHA's authority to enforce its  multi-employer policy against controlling entities as \nwell as the  provisions in the proposed rule that would impose specific duties on  controlling entities. (ID-\n0166.1; -0197.1; -0214.1; -0232.1.) OSHA  explained in detail in the proposed rule why it has such authority \n(see  73 FR 59731 -59733, Oct. 9, 2008). Paragraph (e) is promulgated as  proposed. Paragraph (f)      \nParagraph (f) requires that where a provision in the rule directs  an operator, crewmember or other employee \nto take a specified action,  it is the employer's responsibility to establish work rules to require  the relevant \nemployees to take that action, and to effectively  communicate and enforce those work rules. This paragraph \nclarifies the  employer's obligations with regard to such provisions. No comments on  this paragraph were \nreceived, and it is being promulgated as proposed  with only a minor grammatical correction.\\9\\ ----------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------      \\9\\ For clarity, OSHA is substituting references to \"shall\" in  \nthe proposed rule with \"must\" in this final rule to remove any  implication that the sentence is descriptive , \nrather than  imperative. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  Paragraph (g)     Some \ncommenters requested that OSHA provide a complete exemption  from subpart CC for subpart V work. As \ndiscussed in Sec.  1926.1410( k),  OSHA has addressed their concerns through exclusions from specific  \nrequirements of the rule.      Most employers engaged in construction work under subpart V are  also \nengaged in general industry work under Sec.  1910.269, which  covers the operation and maintenance of \nelectric power generation,  transmission, and distribution installations. The requirements for  mechanical \nequipment in Sec.  1910.269(p) are at least as protective as  the requirements in Sec. Sec.",

Finally, the commenter \nasserted that  articulating cranes should be exempt from the requirement for outrigger  position sensor \nmonitors because such cranes use stabilizers rather  than outriggers.     OSHA agrees with the commenter \nthat boom angle indicators, jib  angle indicators, and boom length indicators are not appropriate for  \narticulating cranes for the reasons given by the commenter.  Accordingly, OSHA is adding Sec.  1926.416(a)(1), \nwhich excludes  articulating cranes from the requirements in Sec. Sec.   1926.1416(e)(1), (e)(2), and (e)(3).     \nOSHA is not exempting articulating cranes from the requirement of  Sec.  1926.1416(e)(5)(i). As discussed \nunder Sec.  1926.1404, for  certain types of cranes, stabilizers serve the same function as  outriggers and, \nwhere appropriate, provisions of the proposed rule that  applied to outriggers are being changed in the final \nrule to also apply  to stabilizers.

Both  commenters suggested that OSHA limit the operator's authority to  specific \nreasons involving a potential violation of a requirement in  subpart CC. (ID -0218.1; 0232.1.)      The \nprovision does not authorize an operator to stop operations for  reasons unrelated to a good faith belief that \nthere may be a safety  problem.

However, \neven in  those instances some time (and associated expense) is involved. -----------------------------------------------\n----------------------------      In the experience of C-DAC members, employers sometimes will  attempt to lift \nloads that exceed a crane's rated capacity in the  belief that the rated capacity is sufficiently conservative to \nperform  the lift. In some such cases, the employer assumes that a safety factor  is built into the capacity \nrating and that the crane actually has a  higher capacity than its rating. In the C-DAC discussions of this  issue, \nmembers explained that while equipment capacity ratings are  developed with consideration of a safety factor, \nthat safety factor is  not intended by the manufacturer to be treated as excess capacity. There are numerous, \ncomplex considerations used by manufacturers in setting the  capacity rating. Employers cannot safely assume \nthat, in any particular  situation, they will not need the benefits conferred by the safety  factor.     There \ncontinue to be a significant number of injuries and  fatalities resulting from equipment overturning. Although \nit has long  been a requirement not to exceed the equipment's rated capacity, a  significant number of \noverturning incidents are caused by exceeding  rated capacity. A study of fatal accidents invol ving cranes in \nthe U.S.  construction industry for 1984-1994, based on investigations of  reported accidents conducted by \nOSHA and states with OSHA -approved  safety and health programs, showed that 22 deaths resulted from  \noverloaded cranes. A. Suruda, M. Egger, & D. Liu, \"Crane -Related  Deaths in the U.S. Construction Industry, \n1984-94,\" p. 12, Table 9,  The Center to Protect Workers' Rights (Oct. 1997). (ID-0013.) By  stressing the need \nboth to comply with the rated capacity and to  separately preclude employers from requiring operators to \nexceed the  rated capacity, paragraphs (o)(1) and (o)(2) should prevent this type  of accident. No comments \nwere received on these paragraphs, and they  are promulgated as proposed.     Another cause of injuries \nand fata lities from overturning equipment  is the use of unreliable information on load weight. OSHA \nconcludes  that one of the ways these incidents can be reduced is to require that  load weight be verified by \na reliable means.     Under Sec.  1926.1417(o)(3), Lo ad weight, the operator is required  to verify that the \nload is within the rated capacity of the equipment  by using the procedures in either Sec.  1926.1417(o)(3)(i) \nor (ii).  Under Sec.  1926.1417(o)(3)(i), the weight of the load must be  determined in one of three ways: \nfrom a source recognized by the  industry, by a calculation method recognized by the industry, or by  other \nequally reliable means. An example of verifying the load weight  from a source recognized by the industry \nwould be where the load is  mechanical equipment and the weight is obtained from its manufacturer.  The \nproposed rule had provided for the weight of the load to be based  on a \"reliable source.\" To avoid the \npotentially subjective  interpretations of \"reliable,\" OSHA is instead requiring in the final  rule that the \nmeasurements be from a source typically relied on in the  industry.     An example of a calculation method \nrecognized by the industry would  be the following: The load is a steel I-beam. After measuring the  thickness \nof the steel and the I -beam's other dimensions, the operator  uses an industry table that shows weight per \nlinear foot for a beam of  these dimensions. The operator then calculates the beam's weight using  that \ninformation. In the proposed rule calculations would be based on a  \"reliable source.\" To avoid the potentially \nsubjective  interpretations of \"reliable,\" OSHA is instead requiring in the final   rule that the calculations be \nbased on a source typically relied on in  the industry.     If the weight of the load is determined under Sec.",

(See Sec.  \n1926.1417 for a  discussion of OSHA's authority to require compliance with manufacturer  procedures.) No \ncomments were received on this pr ovision; it is  promulgated as proposed.  General Comment      A \ncommenter suggested that OSHA consider requiring a written permit  as a precondition to any work being \ndone closer than 20 feet to a power  line.\\66\\ (ID-0201.1.) The permit, according to this commenter, should  \ndocument many of the requirements of this section, including the basis  for the employer's infeasibility \ndeterminations, the utility owner/  operator's or registered professional engineer's determination of a  \nminimum clearance distance, the specific procedures to be followed in  performing the work, verification that \nthe employees have received the  required training, and other information relevant to the work. The  \ncommenter did not explain why it believed such a permit system would  result in greater safety, but OSHA \ninfers that the commenter believes  that the need to document certain information, such as the basis for  the \nemployer's infeasibility findings, will lead to more careful  consideration of the factors that enter into the \ndecision that it is  necessary to work closer to a power line than is normally permitted and  more carefully \nthought out procedures when such work is done. OSHA is  not convinced that a permit system is needed to \nensure that employers  act carefully under thi s section. OSHA expects that the stringent  precautions \nrequired when employers work closer than the Sec.   1926.1408 and Sec.  1926.1409 clearance distances \nwill ensure that an  employer will only determine that it is infeasible to work within those  distances if there \nis really no other viable option. Similarly, the  requirement that a minimum clearance distance must be \ndetermined by a  utility owner/operator or registered professional engineer ensures that  sound expert \njudgment will enter into that determination without the  need for additional documentation. --------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------      \\66\\ This commenter recommended that 20 feet should be \nthe  minimum clearance distance for all work and that Table A of Sec.   1926.1408 should be deleted. OSHA \nexplained in Sec.  1926.1408 why  it was rejecting this suggestion. ------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------  Subpart V Work     In the proposed rule, OSHA discussed in detail the compliance  duties \nthe rule would impose on employers engaged in subpart V work  (see 73 FR 59762 -59764, Oct. 9, 2008). \nIndustry representatives  objected to some of the changes from the requirements of subpart V.  Among \nother things, they pointed to another ongoing rulemaking in which  OSHA proposed to amend subpart V in \nways that differ from the changes  proposed by C-DAC (70 FR 34821, Jun. 15, 2005).\\67\\ ---------------------------\n------------------------------------------------      \\67\\ The subpart V proposed rule was published after C -DAC  \ncompleted its work.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      OSHA proposed \nrequirements in addition to those in subpart V  because it had already concluded that the measures required \nby subpart  V for the operation of equipment near power lines are insufficiently  protective. (See the \ndiscussion of Sec.  191 0.269(p)(4) in the preamble  to the final rule promulgating the general industry \nstandard on the  operation and maintenance of electric power generation, transmission,  and distribution \ninstallations (59 FR 4320, 4400-4404, Jan. 31, 1994)).  Although proposed subpart V would require measures \nthat are  sufficiently protective, OSHA has not yet adopted it as a final rule.  Consequently, the Agency is \ntaking action today to increase the  protection currently afforded by subpart V. In doing so, OSHA has also  \naddressed the concerns raised by utility industry representatives.      First, as discussed above, OSHA has \nmade several changes to the  final rule in response to comments  from the electric utility industry.  These \ninclude: (1) An expanded exclusion for digger derricks used in  utility pole work; (2) deleting the requirement",

(ID-0184.1; -0206.1.) To be clear, the new standard does not prohibit the use of \nremote  controls. During the hearing on this rulemaking, a witness from a  lumber trade association testified \nthat the use of portable radio  remote controls is common, and provided examples of operators with  their \nremotes strapped around their waists or their shoulders. (ID- 0341; -0345.13.) He explained that the \"operator \nis physically located  at the same location as the remote control and is therefore able to  perform controlled \noperations as quickly as an operator who is seated  at the top seat controls\" and \"can also be positioned to \nensure that  there's no obstructed view.\" (ID-0341.) Such use would not be  prohibited. Where an operator \ntakes the remote controls out of the cab,  keeps the controls within reach in the same manner as if in the cab,  \nand is able to use the remote controls to control the equipment as  effectively as if in the cab, the operator \nhas not left the controls  within the meaning of Sec.  1926.1417(e). Therefore, the operator is  not subject \nto the conditions of Sec. Sec.  1926.1417(e)(1)(i) through  (iv).     Section 1926.1417(e) requires that the \noperator not leave the  controls while the load is suspended except when four conditions,  outlined in Sec. \nSec.  1926.1417(e)(1)(i) through (e)(1)(iv), are met.  OSHA has revised the introductory text to make it clear \nthat each one  of the conditions  in Sec. Sec.  1926.1417(e)(1)(i) through (e)(1)(iv)  must be met for the \noperator to leave the controls.      Paragraph (e)(1)(i) requires the operator to remain adjacent to the  \nequipment and not engage in any other duties. This paragraph will not  only prevent unauthorized use of the \ncrane by persons who are not  competent crane operators but also allow the operator to quickly access  the \ncontrols in case the equipment or load inadvertently moves.      Paragraph (e)(1)(ii) requires the load to be \nheld suspended for a  period of time exceeding normal lifting operations. As explained above,  these are \ninstances when the load is \"held suspended,\" that is,  without need for adjustment of the load's or the \nequipment's position-- for an extended period. These are circumstances in which the operator  will not need \nto manipulate the controls. Such circumstances must be  for a period of time in excess of the periods that \noccur during normal  lifting operations.     For example, during the construction of a structure,  a large  \nsubassembly is being attached to another part of the structure. After  the subassembly has been initially \nconnected, it is held suspended  (that is, without need for adjustment of position) for support for  several \nhours while the final connections are made. This period exceeds  normal lifting operations. In this example, \nthe criterion of Sec.   1926.1417(e)(1)(ii) would be met.     Another, contrasting example is the following: \nA steel structure is  being erected. When installing the steel beams, the operator holds the  beam suspended \n(typically for several minutes) while it is initially  connected. Holding the beam suspended in such instances is \na normal  part of the steel erection process. In this example the criterion in  Sec.  1926.1417(e)(1)(ii) would \nnot be met and the operator cannot  leave the controls.     Paragraph (e)(1)(iii) requires the competent \nperson to determine  that it is safe for the operator to leave the controls and implement  measures necessary \nto restrain the boom hoist and telescoping, load,  swing, and outrigger functions. This provision addresses the \nhazard of  inadvertent movement while the controls are unattended.     Paragraph (e)(1)(iv) requires \nbarricades or caution lines, and  notices to be erected to prevent all employees from entering the fall  zone. \nFurthermore, under this paragraph no employees would be permitted  in the fall zone, including those listed \nin Sec.

This approach is  comprised of the following \nsteps: (1) Identify the work zone and assess  it for power lines--determine how close the crane could get to \nthem. The  employer has the option of doing this assessment for the area 360 degrees  around the crane or \nfor a more limited, demarcated area; (2) If the assessment  shows that the crane could get closer than a trigger \ndistance--20 feet for  lines rated up to 350 kV (50 feet for lines rated over 350 kV) --then requirements  for \nadditional action will be triggered.      The voltages given in the final rule are phase -to-phase system  \nvoltages on the power lines. It should be noted that the system  voltages for power lines generally take three \nforms. First, there is  the actual voltage on the line. This voltage varies from one moment to  the next as \nconditions on the power line change. Second, there is the  nominal voltage on the line that is used to designate \nits voltage. The  actual operating voltage varies above and below this voltage. (See the  definition of \"voltage, \nnominal\" in subpart K of the Construction  Standards, Sec.  1926.449.) Third, there is the maximum operating",

This section is designed to address these  problems so that ground conditions will be made \nsufficient for safe  equipment operations.     One commenter asserted that, with respect to digger derricks, \nthe  ground conditions provision should be changed. In particular, the  commenter stated that the \nCommittee should incorporate by reference  secs. 7 through 10 of ANSI/ASSE A10.31 -2006, Safety \nRequirements,  Definitions, and Specifications for Digger Derricks; American National  Standard for \nConstruction and Demolition Operations. (ID -0178.1.) In addition,  the commenter asserted that the \nANSI/ASSE standard \"addresses worksite  selection that is clearer than what OSHA has proposed. For example, \nthe  proposed rule does not recognize the danger that ditches can have on  placement, which is a common \noccurrence.\"     OSHA first notes that these suggestions apply only to digger  derricks and thus interprets \nthe comment as a recommendation that  digger derricks be treated differently than other equipment under \nSec.   1926.1402. As we noted in the preamble to the proposed rule, the  Committee determined that the \nfailure to have adequate ground  conditions is a significant safety problem. The Committee's  determination \nthat this safety problem exists for various types of  equipment is underscored by the application of Sec.  \n1926.1402 to  nearly all equipment covered by this subpart. In addition, where the  Committee intended for \ncertain equipment to be exempted from Sec.   1926.1402, it indicated that expressly (see, e.g., Sec.  \n1926.1440,  Sideboom Cranes). OSHA defers to the expertise of the Committee on this  issue.     Secondly, \nOSHA has reviewed ANSI/ASSE A10.31 -2006 and found that it  is substantively distinguishable from Sec.  \n1926.1402. Specifically,  the two standards differ in the assignment of responsibilities. ANSI/  ASSE A10.31-\n2006 divides responsibilities a mong digger derrick dealers/  installers, owners, users, and operators. Notably, \ncontrolling entities  (who often do not fall into any of the ANSI/ASSE A10.31-2006  categories) are assigned \nno responsibility at all. Furthermore, the  discussion of worksite conditions is included only in sec. 10,  \nResponsibilities of Operators. ANSI/ASSE A10.31 -2006 places the  responsibility of examining ground \nconditions entirely on the operator.  Also, ANSI/ASSE A10.31-2006 does not require that the ground condition  \nrequirements be met before the equipment is installed; it requires only  that the worksite be surveyed before \nthe digger derrick is used. In  sum, OSHA concludes that Sec.  1926.1402 is more effective than ANSI/  ASSE \nA10.31-2006 and declines to incorporate ANSI /ASSE A10.31-2006 by  reference.     The Agency disagrees \nwith the commenter that Sec.  1926.1402 fails  to adequately address ditches. The hazard posed by a ditch \nis that the  ground is less firm in the area adjacent to it. Under Sec.  1926.1402,  the ground must be \nsufficiently firm to provide \"adequate support\"  for the equipment. The section as proposed therefore \naddresses this  hazard. Paragraph (a) Definitions     Paragraph (a) provides definitions of key terms used in \nthis  section. The term \"ground conditions\" is defined as the ability of  the ground to support the equipment \n(including slope, compaction and  firmness). The Committee determined that slope, compaction and firmness  \nare the key factors that are involved in the ability of the ground to  support the equipment.     \"Supporting \nmaterials\" is defined as meaning blocking, mats,  cribbing, marsh buggies (in marshes/wetlands), or similar \nsupporting  materials or devices. Such materials typically help to distribute the  load of the crane over a \nbroad area and/or assist in leveling the  equipment. The list in the definition of examples of such materials is  \nnonexclusive--it includes similar materials and devices that would  serve the same purpose(s).     The one \ncomment that was received that referenced this provision is  addressed in the discussion below of Sec.",

Sec.  1926.1431(o), (p), (r),  \nand (s), including alternatives to the use of a pe rsonnel platform.  Each of the exceptions is discussed below \nunder the particular  paragraph related to that operation.      No comments were received on Sec.  \n1926.1431(b); it is promulgated  as proposed except that \"must\" replaces \"shall\" to ensure that the  sentence \nis imperative, not merely descriptive. Paragraph (c) Equipment Set-Up     This paragraph sets forth the basic \ncriteria for equipment set -up  for personnel hoisting.      Paragraph (c)(1) of this section requires the \nequipment to be on  level, firm and stable footing. A qualified person must determine if  the footing is \n\"sufficiently firm and stable.\" Stable footing is  essential to minimize the hazard of the equipment tipping while  \nhoisting personnel. C-DAC determined that the danger of the equ ipment  potentially tipping when hoisting \npersonnel justifies the need for a  qualified person to examine and approve the equipment's stability. OSHA  \nagrees.     Paragraph (c)(2) specifies that each outrigger must be both  extended and locked. The amount \nof extension must be the same for all  outriggers and also be in accordance with the manufacturer's  \nspecifications. Proper placement and deployment of outriggers, C-DAC  concluded, is essential to prevent the \nhazard of equipment tipping  while hoisting pe rsonnel.     Equal extension of outriggers eliminates the \nhazard of the operator  forgetting that one or more outriggers has a shorter extension and  swinging into \nthat area with a load that exceeds the crane's capacity.  The essential factor is to have each outrigger extended \nequally within  the manufacturer's specifications and procedures, whether it is a full  or partial extension. \nNo comments were received on Sec.  1926.1431(c);  it is promulgated as proposed. Paragraph (d) Equipment \nCriteria     This paragraph sets forth requirements for the equipment used to  hoist personnel.      \nParagraph (d)(1) of this section, Capacity: Use of suspended  personnel platform, limits the total load to 50 \npercent of the  equipment's rated capacity and specifies that the total load includes  the hook, load line, and \nrigging. The 50 percent capacity limit does  not apply during equipment proof testing.      The 50 percent \nlimit reflects C-DAC's conclusion that using this  equipment to hoist personnel requires a greater number of \nsafety  precautions than when lifting materials. The limit provides for an  extra margin of safety to prevent \noverloading the equipment, which  could cause tip-over or structural collapse.     One commenter asserted \nthat a specific boom limit of not less than  65 degrees should be added to the requirements of this paragraph. \n(ID- 0178.1.) The commenter did not provide any rationale for this  recommendation. Therefore, OSHA defers \nto C -DAC's expertise in this  area and  is promulgating this provision as proposed.      Paragraph (d)(2), \nCapacity: Use of boom -attached personnel  platforms, establishes the load limit at 50 percent of rated \ncapacity  for platforms that are attached to the boom. It also provides an  exception to the 50 percent \ncapacity limit during equipment proof  testing. The same reasons for the 50 percent limit in Sec.   \n1926.1431(d)(1) apply here.      In the proposed rule, OSHA requested public comment on whether  \nadditional requirements (i.e., requirements other than those specified  in the proposed rule for a suspended \npersonnel platform) should apply  when using boom -attached personnel platforms. No comments were \nreceived  stating that this type of platform could  present an additional hazard  to employees. One \ncommenter stated that this type of platform is safer  than a suspended personnel platform. (ID-0144.1.) Since \nno comments or  information were received demonstrating that precautions beyond those  already \nproposed are needed for boom attached personnel platforms, OSHA  has not added any further requirements \nfor this type of platform in the  final rule. Therefore, this paragraph is promulgated as proposed.      \nParagraph (d)(3), Capacity: Hoisting personnel without a personnel  platform, establishes the load limit at 50 \npercent of rated capacity.  In calculating the load, the weight of the personnel, including the  hook, load line,",

OSHA determines that the commenters are correct in suggesting that  some additional \nspecificity is needed in the definition to ensure that  only entities using sufficiently stringent accrediting \ncriteria are  included. In the preamble to the proposed rule, OSHA identified two  organizations that it \ndetermined were examples of a \"nationally  recognized accrediting agency\" --the National Commission for \nCertifying  Agencies (NCCA) and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)  (see 73 FR 59811, Oct. 9, \n2008). No commenters have suggested that  these are inappropriate examples of this term. Therefore, to \nprovide  greater specificity, OSHA has modified the language used in th e  proposed rule's definition to \ninclude references to NCCA and ANSI as  examples of organizations that meet the final rule definition in Sec.   \n1926.1401.     Section 1926.1427(b)(1)(ii)(A) specifies that the written and  practical tests administered by \nthe testing organization must, at a  minimum, assess the knowledge and skills listed in Sec. Sec.   \n1926.1427(j)(1) and (2). Those subjects are discussed below under Sec.   1926.1427(j).     Paragraph \n(b)(1)(ii)(B) provides that the testing organization mus t  provide different levels of certification based on \nequipment capacity  and type. This requirement is designed to ensure that a certified  operator has the \nknowledge and skill needed to safely operate equipment  of the type and capacity the employee will actually \nbe operating while  avoiding the need for employees to know how to operate more complex  equipment.     \nIn the proposed rule, OSHA gave examples of what this provision  means in practice. It stated, as one example, \nan employee who only  operates a hydraulic truck crane would not need to also have the  additional \nknowledge and skills necessary to operate a lattice boom  crawler crane. As another, it said that an employee \nwho operates only a  22 ton capacity hydraulic truck crane would not need to also have the  additional \nknowledge and skills necessary to operate a 300 ton  hydraulic truck crane. The Agency further stated that \ncertification on  a more complex type of equipm ent would typically qualify an operator to  operate lower-\ncapacity equipment of the same type, e.g., certification on  a 300 ton hydraulic crane would qualify an \noperator to operate a 22 ton  hydraulic crane.     None of the commenters opposed allowing ope rators \ncertified to  operate at a given capacity from also operating lower -capacity  equipment of the same type. \nTwo commenters recommended that \"type,\"  for purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B), be defined for mobile \ncranes  as they are defined in ASME B30 .5. (ID -0205.1; -0213.1.) These  commenters also stated that \n\"qualifications (and certification) should  be driven by the knowledge and skill required to operate a piece of  \nequipment. When a body of knowledge or a particular skill set for a  particular 'type' of crane changes, then \nso should the appropriate  category of certification/qualification.\"      The Agency concludes that a \ndescriptive definition of \"type\" that  addresses the point raised by these commenters would better accomplish  \nthe purpose of the term than tying it to specific examples of existing  technology. Therefore, OSHA has added \na definition of the word \"type\"  to Sec.  1926.1401 of the final rule.      Examples of many of the various \ntypes of cranes currently in use  are described in the ANSI B30 series (see, for example, ASME B30.5 -2004  \nfor mobile cranes and ASME B30.3-2004 for construction tower cranes).  For example, in this context, truck-\nmounted telescoping boom cranes,  truck-mounted non-telescoping boom cranes, and crawler cranes are \nthree  different \"types,\" since the specific bodies of knowledge and skills  needed for the safe operation of \neach category is different (although  they are not completely distinct --the knowledge and skill sets overlap  \nto some degree).      Commenters and witnesses from the railroad industry believed that  certification \nbased on \"equipment capacity and type\" did not address  unique conditions in their industry because current \ncertification  examinations did not cover the types of cranes they use or the  circumstances under which they",

Section 1926.1434 applies to modifications or  additions that affect the capacity or safe \noperation of the equipment  except where the requi rements of paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3)  of Sec.  \n1926.1434 are met. OSHA determines that it is unnecessary to  apply Sec.  1926.1434 to the use of a \nsubstitute operational aid  because, as long as the substitute device works properly, its use will   not affect \nthe capacity or safe operation of the equipment. No comments  were received on this paragraph, and it is \npromulgated as proposed.  Paragraph (d) Category I Operational Aids and Alternative Measures      The \nstandard categorizes operational aids by the amount of time  permitted for the use of temporary alternative \nmeasures in place of the  listed operational aids. Employers must ensure the repair of Category I  operational \naids, addressed by paragraph (d), no later than 7 days  after the deficiency occurs. Category II operational aids, \naddressed  below by paragraph (e), have a 30 -day time limit for repair. Except  where noted, C -DAC \nrecommended each of these aids  for the reasons set  forth below. The Committee further determined that \neach of the  temporary alternative measurers would be safe to use until the  deficient operational aid was \nrestored to proper service within the  time required under the section. OSHA  agrees. (For purposes of  \nclarification, the Agency has added a reference to Sec.  1926.1416(d)  noting that the requirements of Sec.  \n1926.1417(j) are applicable. See  further discussion at Sec.  1926.1417(j).)      Both Category I and II have \nan exception to the repair time limits.  For Category I, if the employer documents that it has ordered the  \nnecessary parts within 7 days of the occurrence of the deficiency, the  repair must be completed within 7 days \nof receipt of the part. For  Category II, if the employer documents that it has ordered the  necessary parts \nwithin 7 days of the date on which the deficiency was  discovered, and does not receive the part in time to \ncomplete the  repair in 30 days, the repair must be completed within 7 days of  receipt of the part. OSHA \ndetermines that these time limits are both  feasible and reflective of the amount of time that it is appropriate \nto  rely on the temporary alternative measures in each category.     During the SBREFA Panel process, one \nSmall Entity Repre sentative  stated that an extended time limit might be required to determine the  \nappropriate part number for older equipment. Therefore, it might not be  possible to order a replacement \nwithin 7 days of the occurrence of the  deficiency. OSHA sought public comment on the extent to which this \nis a  problem. OSHA further sought comment on how to accommodate employers  when the unavailability \nof a part number hinders them from ordering a  replacement part. OSHA did not receive comments on these \nissues.     The SBREFA Panel also questioned whether the number of \"days\" for  ordering parts and \ncompleting repairs for operational aids refers to  calendar days or business days. Absent a different definition \nin the  standard, OSHA interpreted the word \"days\" to mean \"working days\"  which, as discussed above in \nrelation to proposed Sec.  1926.1407(e),  would mean Mondays through Fridays, excluding Federal holidays. \nOSHA  sought public comment on whether a different definition of \"days\"  should apply under this section.     \nOne commenter stated that the use of the term \"days\" is unclear.  (ID-0143.1.) Two commenters stated it was \nC-DAC's intention that the  term \"days\" mean calendar days as opposed to business days. The  commenters \nstated that the circumstances in Sec.  1926.1407(e), where  the rule uses business days, are unique because \npower companies are not  open/available on weekends.     OSHA concludes that the 7 and 30 day time \nframes should ref er to  calendar days. The periods correspond to one calendar week and one  typical \ncalendar month, and it is, therefore, easy to determine when  the period ends if they mean calendar days.",

While OSHA received no comments to proposed Sec.   1926.1440(c), it decided to retain \nthese 12 subparagraphs in the final  rule because the Committee determined that these ASME requirements \nare  necessary and appropriate for sideboom cranes, and represent current  best practices for the industry.     \nThe 12 subparagraphs retained in Sec.  1926.1440(c) of the final  rule refer to the following sections of ASME \nB30.14-2004: 14 -1.1  (\"Load Ratings\"); 14-1.3 (\"Side Boom Tractor Travel\"); 14 -1.5  (\"Ropes and Reeving \nAccessories\"); 14 -1.7.1 (\"Booms\"); 14 -1.7.2  (\"General Requirements--Exhaust Gases\"); 14 -1.7.3 (\"General  \nRequirements--Stabilizers (Wheel -Type Side Boom Tractors)\"); 14 -1.7.4  (\"General Req uirements--Welded \nConstruction\"); 14-1.7.6 (\"General  requirements--Clutch and Brake Protection\"); 14 -2.2.2 (\"Testing-- Rated \nLoad Test\"), except that it applies only to equipment that has  been altered or modified; paragraph (a) of 14-\n3.1.2 (\"Operator  Qualifications\") except that the phrase \"when required by law\" is  omitted; paragraphs (e), \n(f)(1)-(f)(4), (f)(6), (f)(7), (h), and (i) of  14-3.1.3 (\"Operating Practices\"), and paragraphs (j), (l), and (m) of  Sec.  \n1926.14-3.2.3 (\"Moving the Load\"). Regarding the last four of  these sections, OSHA is stipulating exceptions, \nor requiring employers  to comply with only specified provisions. OSHA wanted to avoid any  duplication, \nconflicts or possible confusion, so the final rule does  not incorporate provisions of the ASME standard that \ndeal with issues  addressed by other provisions of this standard. The incorporated  provisions consist of \nrequirements that are specific to sideboom  cranes. Section 1926.1441 \"Requirements for Equipment With a \nRated Hoisting/ Lifting Capacity of 2,000 Pounds or Less     Section 1926.1441 establishes the requirements \napplicable for  equipment with a maximum -rated hoisting/lifting capacity of 2,000  pounds. The section \ncovers equipment designed and built at the jobsite,  as well as manufactured equipment. In the proposal, the \nintroductory  paragraph used the term \"manufacturer-rated\" that appeared in the C - DAC Document. OSHA \nrequested public comment on this whether to use the  term \"rated\" instead of \"manufacturer-rated\" to clarify \nthat the  section applied to both jobsite -built and manufactured equipment. OSHA  received only two \ncomments, and both commenters supported this revision  because it would clarify application of the section. \n(ID-0205.1; - 0213.1.) Therefore, OSHA made the proposed revision in the final rule.     OSHA also solicited \npublic comment on whether the maximum rated  capacity for application of this section should be revised \nbecause of  crane-technology advancements or other considerations. Two commenters,  one from the sign-\ninstallation industry and the other from the  utilities industry, commented that OSHA should increase the \nmaximum  rated capacity cut-off for application of this section to not more than  10,000 pounds. (ID-0162.1; \n-0189.1.) The sign-installation  representative commented that the operator-qualification requirements  of \nSec.  1926.1441 would encourage employers to use sm aller cranes at  or near their maximum rated capacity. \nThis commenter indicated that  using 2,000-pound rated-capacity equipment in such a way is less safe  than \nusing higher capacity equipment, which would be operated below its  rated capacity, and at a more optimum \nboom angle. The utilities - industry commenter suggested coupling the 10,000 pound cut -off with a  boom \nlength of 25 feet. A representative from the materials -delivery  industry testified during the hearing of the \nproposed rule that OSHA  should exempt truck-mounted articulated-boom loaders of 10,000 pounds  or less, \nstating that the State of California has such an exemption.

Therefore, OSHA added paragraph (g)(1) to this section of the final  rule to \nmake clear that the general anchorage criteria in Sec.   1926.502 apply to equipment covered by subpart CC \nonly as delineated in  paragraph (g)(2), discussed below (see also discussion above of Sec.   1926.500). -----\n----------------------------------------------------------------------      \\102\\ \"Personal fall arrest system\" and \n\"Positioning device  system\" are defined in Sec.  1926.1401. These definitions parallel  those in Sec.  \n1926.500(b) of subpart M. \"Fall restraint system\"  is also defined in Sec.  1926.1401. This defini tion parallels \nthe  one in Sec.  1926.751 of subpart R. As with other definitions  applicable to this section, C -DAC \nendeavored, to the extent possible  and appropriate, to use terminology that is familiar to the  industry. ----\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------      Paragraph (g)(2) of this section, Anchorages for \npersonal fall  arrest and positioning device systems, contains requirements for  anchorage points used in \npersonal fall arrest and positioning device  systems (this was denominated paragraph (f) in the proposed rule).  \nSections 1926.1423(g)(2)(i) and 1926.1423(g)(2)(ii) permit personal  fall arrest systems and positioning \nsystems to be anchored to any  apparently substantial part of the equipment unless a competent person,  \nfrom a visual inspection, without an engineering analysis, would  conclude that the applicable criteria in Sec.  \n1926.502 of subpart M of  this part would not be met. An apparently substantial part of the  equipment is a \npart that would appear substantial to a reasonable  competent person. The subpart M criteria include, for \npersonal fall  arrest systems, 5,000 pounds per employee or twice the potential impact  load of an \nemployee's fall (in addition to other re quirements) (Sec.   1926.502(d)(15)); for a positioning device, 3,000 \npounds or twice the  potential impact load of an employee's fall, whichever is greater (in  addition to other \nrequirements) (Sec.  1926.502(e)(2)).      Most of the equipment covered by the standard is designed to lift  \nand support weights much heavier than these. Apparently substantial  parts of the equipment are, therefore, \ntypically capable of meeting the  subpart M capacities. Consequently, C-DAC determined that the criteria  in \nSec. Sec.  1926.1423(g)(2)(i) and 1926.1423(g)(2)(ii) are  appropriate and would avoid burdening employers \nwith what it considered  to be the unnecessary expense of obtaining engineering analyses for  each part that \nwould serve as an anchor. (See the discussion of these  provisions in the preamble of the proposed rule under \nproposed rule  paragraph (f) of this section, 73 FR 59802, Oct. 9, 2008.)      One commenter suggested \nrevising the provision to require a  competent person to supervise the selection, use, and inspection of  fall \narrest and positioning anchorages. (ID-0178.1.) This commenter  suggested that this revision was needed to \navoid compatibility issues  and to emphasize the competent person's planning role. OSHA declines to  adopt \nthe commenter's suggestion. As explained above, this provision is  included because the suitability of \nsubstantial parts of the equipment  for anchoring fall a rrest and positioning device systems will often be  \nreadily apparent, and the employer will only need to seek a competent  person's judgment if there is some \nquestion as to the anchorage's  suitability. The revision suggested by the commenter would contravene  this \nintent.     Paragraph (g)(2)(iii) requires that attachable anchor devices  (portable anchor devices that are \nattached to the equipment) meet the  applicable anchorage criteria in Sec.  1926.502(d)(15) for personal  \nfall arrest systems and Sec.  1 926.502(e)(2) for positioning device  systems. These criteria are the same as \nthose discussed with respect to  paragraph (g)(2) for personal fall arrest and positioning device  systems.",

OSHA has added that statement of meaning directly in paragraph  (c)(6)(i) in \nthe final rule and has removed paragraph (m). C -DAC  determined that portability should be limited to \ncertification under  Option (1) because the degree of consistency in adhering to the  requirements of this \nsection is likely to be highest among accredited  crane operator testing organizations because they are fully \nindependent  and their business interest d epends on their continued accreditation.  Under paragraph \n(c)(6)(ii), a qualification under Option (2) is valid  for exactly five years.     A trade association stated that \nqualification under Option (2) of  this section (as well as Options (3) and (4)) should, like  certification under \nOption (1), also be portable. (ID-0214.1.) The  commenter stated that there was no rational reason to adopt a \nrule  where portability is restricted to Option (1) certifications. However,  OSHA concludes that C -DAC's \ndecision to accord full portability only to  a certification under Option (1) is sound. A certification issued under  \nOption (1) is based on tests that are completely independent of any  particular employer. Moreover, the \ncommenter's nominee to C -DAC did not  dissent on this issue and the commenter has not explained the \nreason  for changing its position. OSHA gives reduced weight to comments by a  nominating organization \nthat are inconsistent with the position its  nominee took on C -DAC.     A utility company sugge sted that \nelectric utilities be able to use  Option (2) without an independent auditor by allowing for an internal  audit \nof the employee training program based on annual employee  inspections, as allowed in Sec.  1910.269(a)(2). \n(ID-0342.) Granting  this request would permit electric utilities to self -certify their  operators. OSHA has \nrejected this option above and does so here for the  same reasons given earlier.      Some commenters \nstated that Option (2) was impractical because  there are currently no individuals who are accredited to carry \nout the  duties of the auditor under the option (ID-0151.1; -0329.1.) OSHA  notes, however, that employers \nhave four years from the effective date  of this standard to comply with Sec.  1926.1427, and the agency  \nanticipates that, if the demand exists for the services of accredited  auditors, they will become available during \nthat time frame.     An operator certification company recommended eliminating Option  (2) because, in \nthe commenter's view, it lacks sufficient safeguards to  ensure the integrity of the qualification process. (ID -\n0330.1.) The  commenter views this Option as a form of self-certification that is  generally inconsistent with \nthe rule's principle of third -party  verification. It suggests that this Option presents an inherent  conflict of \ninterest based on the incentive that employers have to pass  their employee-operators and that the conflict is \nnot cured by an  auditor's oversight of the program. OSHA disagrees. Under this option,  the auditor must be \nindependent of the employer and certified by an  accredited testing organization. In OSHA's view, these \nrequirements  provide adequate assurance that a testing program approved by the  auditor is of high quality \nand reliability. Paragraph (d) Option (3): Qualification by the U.S. Military      Proposed Sec.  1926.1427(d) \nprovided that an operator who is an  employee of the United States military would be deemed qualified if he/ \nshe had a current qualification issued by the U. S. military. The  criteria for qualification under Option (3) would \nbe left to the  military to determine, including the length of time such a  qualification would be valid. \nQualification under this option would not  be portable unless it meets the requirements of Option (1) of this  \nsection.     Unlike Options (1) and (2), Option (3) is available, in accordance  with the requirements of \nparagraph (d), whether or not the equipment is  operated within the jurisdiction of a State or local \ngovernment that  has its own operating licensing requirement. The Agency notes that in  its comments \nrequesting mandatory compliance with State licensing  requirements, New York State noted that it did not \nintend to supplant  Option (3). (ID-0171.1.)",

C -DAC \nconcluded that compliance with  these training and certification requireme nts will not only reduce the  \nfrequency of power-line contact, but will give the workers the knowledge  they need to help avoid injury in \nthe event such contact occurs.      Fatalities that involve employees being struck or crushed during  \nassembly/disassembly are addressed in Sec. Sec.  1926.1403 -1926.1406.  These sections require employers \nto follow specific safe -practice  procedures, and to address a list of specific hazards. Also, assembly  and \ndisassembly of a crane must be supervised by an individual w ho is  well qualified to ensure that these \nrequirements of these provisions  are properly implemented.      As the above -mentioned studies show, \nand the Committee's experience  confirms, many disassembly accidents occur when sections of lattice  \nbooms unexp ectedly move and strike or crush an employee who is  disassembling the boom. The final \nstandard addresses this hazard in  Sec.  1926.1404(f) by prohibiting employees from being under the boom  \nwhen pins are removed unless special precautions are taken to p rotect  against boom movement.      \nAccidents resulting from boom or cable failure are addressed in a  number of provisions. For example, the \nstandard includes requirements  for: proper assembly procedures (Sec.  1926.1403); boom stops to  \nprevent booms from being raised too far and toppling over backwards  (Sec.  1926.1415, Safety devices); a \nboom-hoist limiting device to  prevent excessive boom travel, and an anti two-block device, which  prevents \noverloading the boom from two -blocking (Sec.  1926.1416,  Operational aids). Also, the inspection \nrequirements (Sec.  1926.1412)  detect and address structural deficiencies in booms before an accident  \noccurs. Cable failure will be avoided by comp liance with sections such  as Sec.  1926.1413, Wire rope --\ninspection, and Sec.  1926.1414, Wire  rope--selection and installation criteria.     Crane tip-over is caused \nby factors such as overloading, improper  use of outriggers and insufficient ground con ditions. Section  \n1926.1417, Operations, includes provisions to prevent overloading. This  section prohibits the equipment \nfrom being operated in excess of its  rated capacity, and includes procedures for ensuring that the weight of  \nthe load is reliably d etermined and within the equipment's rated  capacity. Section 1926.1404(q) has \nrequirements for outrigger/  stabilizer use that will ensure that outriggers and stabilizers provide  stability \nwhen a load is lifted. Section 1926.1402 contains  requirements to ensure sufficient ground conditions, which \nwill prevent  crane tip -over.     The provisions addressing operator training, qualification, and  \ncertification also will prevent tip-over accidents by ensuring that the  operator is sufficiently knowledgeable \nand skilled to recognize  situations when the crane may be overloaded.      Fatalities that result from \nworkers being struck by the cab or  counterweights will be avoided under Sec.  1926.1424, Work area  \ncontrol. That section requires that workers who are near equipment with  a rotating superstructure be trained \nin the hazards involved, that  employers mark or barricade the area covered by the rotating  superstructure, \nand that the operator be notified whenever a worker  must enter that area, and instructed not rotate the \nsuperstructure  until the area is clear. Protection against being struck by a  counterweight during assembly \nor disassembly is provided by Sec.   1926.1404(h)(9), which requires the assembly/disassembly supervisor to  \naddress this hazard and take steps when necessary to protect workers  against that danger.     The final rule \naddresses a number of equipment failures that can  result in the load stri king a worker. Such accidents are \ndirectly  addressed by Sec.  1926.1425, Keeping clear of the load, and Sec.   1926.1426, Free fall/controlled \nload lowering. In addition, improved  requirements in Sec. Sec.  1926.1419 -1926.1422 for signaling will help  \navoid load struck -by accidents caused by miscommunication.      Improper operation, including failure to",

The purpose is to have ready access to manufacturer's operating  information when \nemployees are on the platform. No comments were  received on this provision; it is promulgated as proposed.     \nParagraph (k)(8)(i), Environmental conditions--Wind, requires a  qualified person to determine if it is unsafe \nto hoist personnel when  the wind speed (gust or sustained) exceeds 20 mph. C-DAC selected this  triggering \nwind speed based in part on ASME B30.23 -2005, which  prohibits personnel hoisting operations when wind \nspeed exceeds 20 mph.  High winds increase the likelihood of platform tipping, sudden  unexpected \nmovement of the platform, or structural failure of the  equipment. While OSHA is declining to set a specific \nwind speed  threshold at which all hoisting operations must cease, it agrees that  20 mph is an appropriate \npoint at which a safety determination be  required. If the qualified person determines that hoisting personnel \nis  unsafe, hoisting operations must not begin or, if already in progress,  must be terminated.     One \ncommenter questioned where and how the wind speed must be  determined. (ID-0120.) With respect to \nwhere the measurement must be  taken, the language of this provision refers to wind speed \"at the  \npersonnel platform.\" This means that a safety determination is  required at any time at which the wind to \nwhich the platform is exposed  exceeds 20 mph, whether the platform is on the ground or suspended.      \nThe provision does not specify any particular type of device or  protocol for taking the measurement. The \nAgency does not determine that  such specificity is needed; any generally accepted method that  accurately \nmeasures wind speed would suffice. Therefore, this paragraph  is promulgated as proposed.     Paragraph \n(k)(8)(ii), Environment al conditions --Other weather and  environmental conditions, requires a qualified \nperson to determine if  it is not safe to hoist personnel when there are indications of  dangerous weather or \nany other impending/existing dangerous  environmental condition. Upon determination that it is unsafe,  \npersonnel hoisting operations must not be started or must be terminated  if already in progress.      \nParagraph (k)(9) requires employees being hoisted to remain in  direct communication with either the signal \nperson (where used) or  equipment operator at all times. In some instances the platform  occupants are in a \nbetter position to see potential problems developing  than the operator, or to recognize there is some other \nsafety-related  need for the operator to take action. In addition, there are instances  when the operator \nbecomes aware of a developing problem and needs to  communicate that information to the employees being \nhoisted. This  provision ensures that such information can be communicated quickly  between the hoisted \nemployees and operator.      No comments were received on paragraphs (k)(8)(ii) or (k)(9); they  are \npromulgated as proposed.      Paragraphs (k)(10)(i) and (ii) , Fall protection, require employees  on the \npersonnel platform to be provided with and use a personal fall  arrest system attached to a structural member \nwithin the personnel  platform. The fall arrest system (including the attachment point) must  comply with \nSec.  1926.502, Fall protection systems criteria and  practices. When hoisting personnel over water, a \npersonal fall arrest  system would not be required since, in the event that an error or  failure occurred \nresulting in the employees being in the water, being  tied-off exacerbates the drowning hazard. However, the \nrequirements of  Sec.  1926.106, Working over or near water, do apply. Upon review of  the rule, the Agency \ndetermined that it would provide greater clarity  if the note referring to the requirements of Sec.  1926.106 \nwas  included in paragraph (k)(10)(ii), instead of at the end of this  paragraph. The regulatory text of the final \nrule reflects this change.      The purpose of this requirement is to protect empl oyees from a fall  hazard \nwhile in the personnel platform in the event of sudden movement,  tipping, or other circumstance in which a \nfall would not be prevented  by the platform's guardrail system.     Paragraph (k)(11)(i), Other load lines, \nmandates that while  hoisting personnel no other lifts may be made with any of the  equipment's other load",

A forklift with a boom  \nattachment affixed to its forks that uses a hook to raise and lower the  load like a crane would be covered by \nsubpart CC. However, as noted in  the preamble to the proposed rule, a forklift would be excluded from  the \ncoverage of subpart CC when its sole means of suspending a load is  a chain wrapped around the fo rks.     \nProposed paragraph (c)(9) excluded mechanics' trucks with hoisting  devices when used in activities related \nto equipment maintenance and  repair.

It has been a longstanding industry  practice to \nmaintain annual inspection documentation as a reference  that the inspection was completed, to identify who \nperformed the  inspections, and to document the results of that inspection.  Paragraph (g) Severe Service      \nParagraph (g) of this section requires the employer to inspect the  equipment when the severity of \nuse/conditions--\"such as loading that  may have exceeded rated capacity, shock loading that may have \nexceeded  rated capacity, [or] prolonged exposure to  a corrosive atmosphere\" -- creates a \"reasonable \nprobability of damage or excessive wear.\" In  such instances, the employer is required to stop using the \nequipment  and have a qualified person \"inspect the equipment for structural  damage;\" determine whether, \nin light of the use/conditions of the  severe service, any items listed in the annual/comprehensive inspection  \nneed to be inspected and if so, inspect them; and if a deficiency is  found, follow the correction/monitoring \nprocedures set forth in Sec.   1926.1412(f)(4)-(f)(6).     Upon review of this paragraph, the Agency \ndetermines that Sec.  1926.1412(g)(1) needs clarification; therefore, OSHA added a  phrase to the provision \nrequiring that a determination be made to  ensure the equipment remains safe for continued use. This \nrevision  emphasizes that this inspection must determine the capability of the  equipment to operate \ncontinuously under severe conditions. No comments  were received on this paragraph, and it is promulgated \nas proposed,  with the exception of the clarification to Sec.  1926.1412(g)(1).  Paragraph (h) Equipment Not \nin Regular Use     Paragraph (h) of this section requires that equipment that sits  idle for three months or \nmore be inspected by a qualified person in  accordance with the monthly inspection provisions of Sec.  \n1926.1412(e)  before being used. This would ensure that deficiencies that may arise  as a result of the \nequipment standing idle are checked before its  subsequent use. The Committee determined that this \ninspection would  need to be done by a qualified person, rather than a competent person,  because some of \nthe deficiencies that may arise from sitting idle  require the qualified person's higher level of ability to detect \nand  assess. (See further discussion at 73 FR 59775, Oct. 9, 2008.) No  comments were received on this \nparagraph. It is promulgated as  proposed. Paragraph (i) [Reserved] Paragraph (j)     Proposed paragraph (j) \nof this section required that any part of a  manufacturer's inspection procedures relating to safe operation \nthat is  more comprehensive or has a more frequent schedule than that required  by this section must be \nfollowed. These inspection procedures include  any information provided by the manufacturer. Examples are \nprovided in  the provision of the types of items that would be considered to relate  to safe operation (\"a \nsafety device or operator aid, critical part of  a control system, power plant, braking system, load-sustaining  \nstructural components, load hook, or in -use operating mechanism\"). The  proposed paragraph goes on to \nstate: \"Additional documentation  requirements by the manufacturer are not required.\"      Several \ncommenters asked that OSHA delete the line in the  regulatory text of Sec.  1926.1412(j) that reads \n\"Additional  manufacturer documentation requirements need not be followed.\" (ID - 0165; -0232; -0235.) \nOSHA acknowledges that the intent of this sentence  is unclear and is not including it in the final rule.     A \nsafety association and a trade association commented that the  thorough and equipment-specific frequency \nof inspections required by  the manufacturer are well suited for the equipment used in their  trades. (ID-\n0184; -0206.) The safety association asserted that  compliance with equipment manufacturers' inspection \nrecommendations  assure a greater degree of safety than compliance with a list of shift,  monthly, and \nannual inspections, which may be deficient with regard to  thoroughness and frequency. The two commenters \nasked that OSHA revise  Sec.  1926.1412 to allow employer -documented compliance with the  inspection \nrecommendations of the equipment man ufacturer as an  alternative to meeting the requirements of Sec.",

Paragraph (e) of this section, Crush/pinch points, provides that  employees who \nwork with equipment covered by this subpart must be  instructed to stay clear of holes, crush/pinch points \nand the hazards  that are addressed in Sec.  1926.1424, Work area control. See the  discussion above of \nhazards and requirements addressed by Sec.   1926.1424. No comments were received on this provision, and \nit is  promulgated as proposed except for the clarification of the employer's  duty to train each employee.      \nParagraph (f) of this section, Tag -out, states that operators and  other employees a uthorized to start or \nenergize equipment or operate  equipment controls (such as maintenance and repair workers) must be  \ntrained according to the tag -out and start-up procedures in Sec.   1926.1417(f) and (g). See the discussion \nabove of these procedures in  Sec.  1926.1417.      On review of this paragraph, OSHA determines that a \nreference to  the start-up procedures was inadvertently omitted in the text of the  proposed rule since these \nemployees are \"authorized to start/energize  equipment.\" OSHA has corrected this omission in the final rule \nby  adding a reference to start-up procedures in Sec.  1926.1417(g) in the  regulatory text.     Paragraph \n(g) of this section requires employers to ensure that  employees understand the required training and provide \nrefresher  training when necessary. Specifically, Sec.  1926.1430(g)(1) requires  the employee to be \nevaluated to verify that he/she understands the  information provided in training required by this subpart. \nThe Agency  determined that, to ensure that the  training is effective, some means  of assessment for \nunderstanding is needed.      One commenter believed this requirement was unclear and did not  \nunderstand how an employer would determine if training was effective.  (ID-0232.1.) This commenter also \nindicated that it could be interpreted  that a test would always be required to determine whether training had  \nbeen effective.     The Agency purposely does not use the term \"test\" in this  paragraph. \"Test\" may be \ninterpreted to mean a standardized written  or a structured oral exam, which may not be appropriate for all  \nsituations. OSHA determines the method of evaluating an employee's  training for effectiveness will vary by \nthe subject matter of the  training and the employee, and the Agency has therefore drafted this  paragraph \nto provide sufficient flexibility for the employer to  determine the most appropriate method of evaluation. \nAny number of  methods could be used to determine if an employee has understood the  training provided. \nFor example, during assembly/disassembly a certain  method of blocking may be needed. The supervisor \ntrains and instructs  the employee on the proper method. The supervisor can then evaluate the  employee's \ncomprehension of training in a number of ways. One way could  be simply to ask the employee to orally \ndescribe how he/she would do  this task, or to have the employee physically emulate the blocking  method. \nAnother would be to provide blocking to the employee and ask  the employee to arrange the blocking in the \nproper mann er. Either  method can give the supervisor the necessary information to determine  if the \nemployee understood the proper method or if additional training  is required.     Another commenter \nrecommended the incorporation by reference of  ANSI/ASSE Z490.1-2001 for how to test trainees. (ID-0178.1.) \nMuch of  sec. 6.2 of that standard reflects the same concepts referred to above  and may be useful to \nemployers. However, a \"Note\" to sec. E6.2.2  suggests that self-evaluations may be adequate. OSHA does not \nconclude  that a self -evaluation is appropriate to meet the requirements of Sec.   1926.1430(g)(1). While \nother aspects of the ANSI/ASSE standard may be  useful as a guide to employers, it is not drafted in a way that \nis  suitable for enforcement of this provision. For these reasons, OSHA  declines to incorporate it by reference \nas a requirement.",

Only a few of these items require discussion.      \nProposed paragraph (f)(2)(xiv) listed \"[o]utrigger pads/floats\"  for excessive wear or cracks.\" The purpose of \nthe inspection of  outrigger pads/floats is to make cer tain that these pads (which are  attached to the \noutrigger and used to distribute the weight of the load  to the ground) will not fail and leave the outrigger \nwithout proper  support. In the final rule, OSHA is referring to \"outrigger or  stabilizer pads/floats\" because \nsome types of equipment, such as  articulating cranes, are designed to use stabilizers instead of  outriggers \nto add stability at their bases. A full discussion of the  comments that prompted this regulatory text change is \nprovided in the  explanation of the rule for Sec.  1926.1404(q).      Proposed paragraph (f)(2)(xv) listed \n\"slider pads for excessive  wear or cracks.\" The word \"cracks\" had not been included in the C- DAC Consensus \nDocument for this item, and two trade associations (ID- 0205.1; -0213.1) commented that \"cracks\" should be \nremoved from the  provision to be consistent with the intent of C-DAC. After examining  how the word came \nto be included in the proposed rule, OSHA concludes  that the word \"cracks\" was added inadvertently to this \nprovision and,  lacking an evidentiary basis to include it, is removing the words \"or  cracks\" from paragraph \n(f)(2)(xv) in the final rule.      Section 1926.1412(f)(2)(xviii) has been modified from the proposed  rule. \nUpon review of this requirement, the Agency found that it was  necessary to clarify this requirement to allow \nthe use of a seat that  is equivalent to the original operator's seat. This provision requires  the employer to \nreplace the original seat with one that provides  function and safety that is equivalent to the original seat. The \ntext  of the final rule has been modified accordingly.      In Sec.  1926.1412(f)(2)(xix) the term \n\"unserviceable\" is  replacing the term \"unusable\" to clarify that the operator's seat must be in good  working \ncondition to allow the operator to safely work at the controls  of the equipment. The text of the final rule has \nbeen modified  accordingly.     Paragraph (f)(3) requires f unctional testing as part of the annual/  \ncomprehensive inspection. No comments were received on this provision.      Paragraphs (f)(4) through (6) \ndelineate the follow -up procedures  that apply when a deficiency is identified during the annual/  \ncomprehensive inspection. The purpose of these provisions is to ensure  that a deficiency that is not yet a \nsafety hazard but may develop into  one is monitored on a monthly basis, and that a deficiency that is a  \nsafety hazard is corrected before the equipment is ret urned to service.      Paragraph (f)(4) provides that \nimmediately following the  identification of a deficiency, the qualified person must determine  \"whether the \ndeficiency constitutes a safety hazard, or though not yet  a safety hazard, needs to be monito red in the \nmonthly inspections.\" No  comments were received and paragraph (f)(4) is promulgated as proposed.      \nParagraph (f)(5) requires that equipment with a deficiency  identified as a safety hazard by the qualified \nperson be removed from  service until the deficiency is corrected. Paragraph (f)(6) requires  the employer to \ncheck the deficiencies in the monthly inspections that  the qualified person had identified as needing \nmonitoring.     In the proposed rule, OSHA discussed an apparent conflict between  Sec.  1926.1412(f)(4) \nand Sec.  1926.1416. Paragraph (f)(2)(v) lists  operational aids among the items that must be included in the \nannual  inspection.\\73\\ Section 1926.1416 permits equipment with operational  aids that are not \nfunctioning properly to continue to be used for  limited periods of time as long as specified alternative \nmeasures are  used while the operational aids are being repaired.

Section \n1926.1437(m) applies only to floating  cranes/derricks, and Sec.  1926.1437(n) applies only to land cranes/ \nderricks used on barges, pontoons, vessels or other means of flotation. Paragraph (a)     Paragraph (a) of this \nsection specifies that the requirements of  Sec.  1926.1437 are supplemental requirements; therefore,  all \nother  requirements of this subpart apply unless specifically noted otherwise.  Section 1926.1437(a) \nexempts equipment operating on jacked barges from  the requirements of Sec.  1926.1437 when the jacks \nare deployed to the  river, lake, or sea bed and the barge is fully supported by the jacks.     A jacked barge \ndeployed in this manner has four \"spuds\" on its  corners that are grounded into the sea-bottom, providing a \nlevel and  stable platform on which employees work. This configuration results in  work conditions similar to \na crane working on land, unlike the work  conditions pertinent to equipment covered by this section. \nTherefore,  equipment used on a jacked barge deployed in this manner is subject to  all other applicable \nrequirements of this prop osed subpart but not to  the requirements of this section.      One commenter \nraised a question as to whether the exclusion of  jacked barges would apply when the barge is supported by \njacks anchored  to the river, lake, or sea bed, but not fully supported \"in a more  permanent condition.\" (ID-\n0172.1.) However, the commenter does not  explain what is meant by \"a more permanent condition.\" The \ntest for  whether the jacks, on deployment in the river, lake, or sea bed, fully  support the barge.     OSHA \nreceived no substantive comments or information indicating  that the exception for jacked barges is unsafe \nfor employees.  Therefore, OSHA is retaining the exception in the final rule because it  determines that \nemployees on jacked barges will be protected by the  other provisions of this subpart. OSHA also is retaining \nthe language  explaining the application of the section because it provides useful  explanatory information \nto the regulated community regard ing compliance  obligations. Paragraph (b) General Requirements      \nParagraph (b) of this section specifies that paragraphs (c) -(k) of  this section apply to both floating \ncranes/derricks and land cranes/ derricks. As noted above and discussed below, Sec.  1926.1437(m)  applies \nonly to floating cranes/derricks, and Sec.  1926.1437(n)  applies only to land cranes/derricks mounted on \nvessels/flotation  devices. OSHA received no comments on the proposed paragraph. OSHA is  retaining the \nparagraph as proposed b ecause it provides useful  explanatory information to the regulated community \nregarding compliance  obligations. Paragraph (c) Work Area Control      Paragraph (c) of this section \nprovides that the requirements of  Sec.  1926.1424, Work area control, apply to equipment covered by this  \nsection, except for the requirements of Sec.  1926.1424(a)(2)(ii).  Paragraph (c)(2) of this section closely \nparallels Sec.   1926.1424(a)(2)(ii) but omits the requirement that employers  demonstrate infeasibility \nbefore using a combination of warning signs  and high visibility markings in place of erecting and maintaining  \ncontrol lines, warning lines, railings, or similar boundaries of hazard  areas. Because equipment covered by \nthis section typically operates  within a very limited physical work space, employers often need  increased \nflexibility in determining which work area control method is  most appropriate in light of special site-specific \ncircumstances. To  help ensure that employees are adequately protected if the employer  uses high visibility \nmarkings to supplement warning signs, this  paragraph requires the employer to train employees to \nunderstand the  meaning of the markings.

Paragraph (j)(2) requires that the \nqualification/certification  examination include a determination through a practical test that the  individual \nhas the skills necessary for the safe operation of the  equipment. It also states criteria for such a test. \nParagraph (j)(2)(i)  requires that an individual demonstrate the ability to recognize, from  visual and auditory \nobservation, the items liste d in proposed Sec.   1926.1412(d), which sets criteria for shift inspections. \nParagraph  (j)(2)(ii) requires the operator to demonstrate operational and  maneuvering skills. Paragraph \n(j)(2)(iii) requires that the operator  demonstrate the ability to apply  load chart information. Paragraph  \n(j)(2)(iv) requires that an operator be able to apply safe shut -down  and securing procedures.      One \ncommenter suggested incorporating standard verbal operation  signals into the certification criteria. (ID -\n0110.1.) A different  commenter asked OSHA to require knowledge of the \"dynamics of boom  flex\" in its \ncriteria for certification. (ID-0125.) To the extent that  knowledge of such signals and the dynamics of boom \nflex are required  for the safe operation of the type of equipment the individual will  operate, they would be \ncovered under Sec.  1926.1427(j)(1)(i). The  examples of the types of information that would be required for  \ncertification are not all inclusive. OSHA defers to C -DAC's experience  with respect to the determination of \nwhich examples should be  highlighted in paragraph (j).      No other comments were received on Sec.  \n1926.1427(j); it is  promulgated as proposed, except that OSHA has corrected \"audible  observations\" to read \n\"auditory observations (observations through the  use of the ear). Paragraph (k) Phase-In     As discussed \nabove, a number of commenters believe that Option (1)  of this section (certification by an accredited testing \norganization)  is the only viable option for many employers and expressed concern  about the availability of \nsufficient accredited testing organizations  to meet the demand that this rule would create. Therefore, in the \nfinal  rule, OSHA has provided a four -year phase-in period for compliance with  paragraph (a)(2), which \nrequires employers to have their operators  certified or qualified under Option (1) (independent certifying  \norganization), Option (2) (audited employer certification), or Option  (3) (U.S. military employees). Paragraph \n(k)(1) of this section of the  final rule sets out different effective dates for the different  provisions of Sec.  \n1926.1427: all provisions except paragraphs (a)(2)  and (f) of this section are enforceable as of the effective \ndate of new  subpart CC, whereas the certification required under paragraph (a)(2)  will not be required until \nthe end of the phase-in period, which is  four years after the effective date of subpart CC.     The phase-in \nperiod does not apply to compliance with licensing  requirements of government entities. Those government \nentities already  require compliance with their own licensing requirements, and OSHA sees  no rationale for \ndelaying compliance with existing law. Employers would  be required to comply with State or local government \nentity licensing  requirements only to the extent that State or local government entity  licenses comply with \nthe \"Federal floor\" established in paragraphs  (e)(2) and (j) of this section. The options available under Sec.   \n1926.1427(a)(2) would remain available, and the four -year phase-in  period would app ly.     As already \ndiscussed, C-DAC determined that the market would  respond to a qualification/certification requirement, and \nthe increase  in the number of accredited testing organizations since C -DAC completed  its consensus \ndocument validates that view (OSHA notes that several  more testing organizations have become accredited \nsince the proposed  rule was issued). There is no evidence in the record that the available  testing \norganizations will be unable to meet the demand even if almost  all employers choose that option. The four \nyear period will provide  time for additional testing organizations to become accredited for  purposes of \nOption (1).     A labor organization suggested that the four-year phase-in period  be reduced to two years.",

This provision would prohibit, for example, rope lubricants that  are opaque \nor so dark that they mask the wire rope inside them. A  commenter suggested adding to this provision the \nfollowing sentence:  \"The rope surface and strand valleys must be cleaned of dirt,  lubricant or other material \nthat will hinder inspection.\" (ID -0121.1.)  OSHA determines that this addition is unnecessary. Section \n1926.1413  requires various inspections, and the requirement t o conduct an  inspection inherently means \nthat where foreign material that would  prevent the inspection is present, it must be removed. The prohibition  \nagainst rope lubricants that are of the type that hinder inspection is  needed because they are diffic ult to \nremove and pose an unnecessary  obstacle to compliance. Section 1926.1413(d) is promulgated in the  final \nrule as proposed. Paragraph (e)     A commenter suggested adding that the competent person who conducts  \nthe shift inspection must receive such information in writing. (ID- 0132.1.) Similarly, OSHA determines that the \ncompetent person or  persons who conduct shift and monthly inspections, and the qualified  person who \nconducts annual inspections, must have access to all written  documents produced under Sec.  1926.1413. \nIn response to this comment,  OSHA is adding paragraph (e) to ensure that persons who conduct  inspections \nhave access to documentation required by Sec.  1926.1413  during the period for which those documents \nmust be retained. This   documentation serves as a reference for conditions that must be  monitored in \nsubsequent inspections. OSHA concludes that this  documentation will ensure that only safe equipment is put \ninto service.  Section 1926.1414 Wire Rope --Selection and Installatio n Criteria      This section sets forth \nrequirements for selecting and installing  wire rope. C -DAC determined, and OSHA agrees, that the proper \nselection  and installation of wire rope is integral to the safe operation of  equipment that uses such rope. \nImproper selection or installation could  cause the wire rope to fail, resulting in any number of hazards from  \nuncontrolled movement of the equipment or the load. As discussed in the  proposed rule, Sec.  1926.1414, \nin addition to addressing safety  concerns related to wire rope selection and installation, provides  greater \nflexibility in the selection process than previous requirements  under subpart N (73 FR 59781, Oct. 9, 2008). \nThis flexibility reflects  and takes advantage of new developments in wire rope technology.  Paragraph (a)     \nProposed paragraph (a) of this section stated that \"selection of  replacement wire rope shall be in accordance \nwith the requirements of  this section and the recommendations of the wire rope manufacturer, the  \nequipment manufacturer, or a qualified person.\" In the proposed rule,  OSHA noted that proposed paragraph \n(a)'s mention of only \"replacement  rope\" could mislead some readers to conclude that all of Sec.   \n1926.1414 applies only to replacement rope, whereas C -DAC clearly  intended that Sec.  1926.1414 would \napply to both original equipment  rope and replacement rope. OSHA proposed to reword Sec.  1926.1414(a)  \nto read as follows: \"Original equipment wire rope and replacement wire  rope shall be selected and installed \nin accordance with the  requirements of this section. Selection of replacement wire rope shall  be in \naccordance with the recommendations of the wire rope  manufacturer, the equipment manufacturer, or a \nqualified person.\"     OSHA requested public comment on such a revision. OSHA received no  comment on \nproposed Sec.  1926.1414(a) or on its proposed rewording.  Accordingly, OSHA modified Sec.  1926.1414(a) \nof the final rule to  reflect t he proposed rewording.  Paragraph (b)      The proposed rule, in Sec.  \n1926.1414(c), included design factors  for rotation resistant rope but did not include design factors for  \nstandard (that is, non-rotation resistant) rope. In the proposal, OSHA  stated its determination that, in light of \nthe importance of design  factors for wire rope, the omission of design factors for standard rope  was \ninadvertent (73 FR 59781, Oct.",

(As discussed below, for \nassembly/disassembly (A/D) work, the Committee  recommended fall protection beginning at 15 feet.) C-DAC \nalso  determined that operators do not need to be tied off while moving to  and from their cabs, a nd \nparagraph (e)(1) of this section, discussed  below, therefore requires fall protection equipment only when \nemployees  are moving point-to-point on booms or while at a work station (with  certain exceptions). The \nCommittee determined that the steps,  handholds, and railings required under Sec.  1926.1423(c) protect \noperators  moving to and from their workstations and eliminate the need for additional  fall protection \nequipment. Paragraph (e)(1) Non-Assembly/Disassembly: Moving Point to Point     Paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this \nsection requires employers to provide  and ensure the use of fall protection equipment at 6 feet and above  \nwhen an employee is moving point to point on non -lattice booms (whether  horizontal or not horizontal). \nMoving point to point is defined in  Sec.  1926.1401 and refers to when an employee is going to or coming",

This is needed  because overloading the \npersonnel platform can occur if the test  weights are not removed and left on the platfo rm when hoisting  \npersonnel.     No comments were received on Sec. Sec.  1926.1431(h)(2) through  (h)(4); they are \npromulgated as proposed.      Under paragraph (h)(5)(i), immediately prior to each personnel  lift, the \ncompetent person must inspect the plat form while it is lifted  a few inches to ensure that the platform is \nsecure and properly  balanced.     The purpose of this procedure is to ensure that, with the occupants  \nand materials/tools to be hoisted on the platform immediately before  the hoist is to take place, the platform \nis secure and properly  balanced. The purpose of having the occupants and materials/tools on  board during \nthis check is twofold. First, it ensures that the check  takes place just before the personnel lift, which minimizes \nthe chance  that damage or other problems affecting the platform's security will  occur after the check. In \naddition, it would be difficult to ensure  that the platform will be properly balanced when in actual use without  \nhaving the employees and materials/to ols on board.      In the proposed rule, the text did not state that \npersonnel and  materials were to be on board during the trial lift (see 73 FR 59941,  Oct. 9, 2008). In the \npreamble to the proposed rule, the Agency asked  for comment on adding the phrase \"with the personnel and \nmaterials/ tools on board\" to clarify the intent of this requirement (see 73 FR  59833, Oct. 9, 2008).     Three \ncomments were received in response to the Agency's request  for comment on this issue. (ID-0104.1; -0205.1; \n-0213.1.) All three  commenters agreed with the Agency's suggested revision. Therefore, the  final rule \nreflects this change in Sec.  1926 .1431(h)(5)(i).     Paragraph (h)(5)(ii) requires a competent person to \ndetermine that  hoist ropes are free of defects, that multiple part lines are not  twisted around each other, \nand that the primary attachment is centered  over the platform. If the load rope is slack, the competent person \nmust  inspect the hoisting system to ensure the rope lines are properly  seated on drums and in sheaves. \nParagraphs (i) and (ii) continue the  requirements from former Sec.  1926.550(g)(5)(iii), with the additional  \nclarification that hoist ropes must be free of deficiencies (that is,  not just free of \"kinks,\" as was required in \nformer Sec.   1926.550(g)(5)(iii)(A)). The purpose of these requirements is to  mandate an additional final \nreview by a competent person to ev aluate  the personnel platform, the balance of the load, and the lifting  \ndevices to ensure that necessary safety requirements are met.      No comments were received on Sec.  \n1926.1431(h)(5) (ii); it is  promulgated as proposed.     Paragraph (h)(6) establishes that any condition that \nfails to meet  the requirements of this standard or otherwise creates a safety hazard  must be corrected \nbefore personnel are hoisted. This includes  conditions found during the trial lift or in any inspection or  \nsubsequent review of the equipment, platform or rigging. No comments  were received for this provision. \nHowever, the following reference has  been added to this provision for clarification: \"(See Sec.  1926.1417  \nfor tag-out and related requirements.).\" This sentence has been added  to ensure the employer is aware of \nthe applicable tag -out and related  requirements of Sec.  1926.1417, Operation.  Paragraph (i) [Reserved.] \nParagraph (j) Proof Testing     This paragraph delineates the requirements of and method for proof  testing \nthe personnel platform and rigging.

OSHA \ndevoted final  paragraphs (g)(2)(i) and (g)(2)(ii) to personal fall arrest systems and  positioning device systems, \nrespectively, and added references to  Sec. Sec.  1926.502(d)(15) and 1926.502(e)(2) to specify which of the  \ncriteria in Sec.  1926.502 of subpart M are applicable to anchorages  used to comply with this section. OSHA \nconcludes these changes improve  the clarity of the final rule. In addition, final paragraph (g) uses  the terms \n\"personal fall arrest\" instead of \"fall arrest\" and  \"fall restraint systems\" instead of \"restraint systems\" to use \nthe  defined terms from Sec.  1926.1401 and maintain consistency with other  construction standards. \nParagraph (h) Tower Cranes     Paragraph (h) of this section specifies fall protection  requirements specific \nto tower cranes. Note that the final rule uses  the terminology \"erecting, climbing, and dismantling\" with \nregard to  tower cranes rather than \"assembly\" and \"disassembly;\" or the term  \"erecting/dismantling\" used \nin the proposed rule, because this  terminology reflects the industry's use of these terms.  Paragraph (h)(1) \nWork Other Than Erecting, Climbing, and Dismantling      Paragraph (h)(1) of this section addresses fall \nprotection  requirements for work other than erecting, climbing, and dismantling.  The employer is required \nto provide and ensure the use of fall protection  equipment for employees who are on a walking/working  \nsurface with an unprotected  side or edge more than 6 feet above a lower level. The exceptions to this  \nrequirement would be when the employee is at or near draw-works (when the  equipment is running), in the \ncab, or on the deck. (See the discussion of  this provision in the preamble of the proposed rule at 73 FR 59803, \nOct. 9, 2008,  where it was designated as paragraph (g)(1)). No comments were received on  this paragraph; \nit is included in the final rule without change other than  its revised heading and redesignation from paragraph \n(g)(1) in the proposed  rule to (h)(1) in the final rule.  Paragraph (h)(2) Erecting, Climbing, and Dismantling      \nProposed Sec.  1926.1423(g)(2) (redesignated Sec.  1926.1423(h)(2)  in the final rule) specified that, for \nerecting/dismantling work,  employers must provide, and ensure the use of, fall protection  equipment for \nemployees who are on a walking/working surface with an  unprotected side or edge more than 15 feet above \na lower level. (See  the discussion of that provision in 73 FR 59803, Oct. 9, 2008.) OSHA  noted in the \nproposed rule that C -DAC did not include the exceptions  that were included in proposed Sec.  \n1926.1423(g)(1) for when the  employee is at or near draw-works (when the equipment is running), in  the \ncab, or on the deck. The Agency stated that it was unaware of any  reason why those exceptions would not be \nequally applicable for Sec.   1926.1423(g)(2), and asked for public comment on this issue (see 73 FR  59803, \nOct. 9, 2008).     OSHA received responses from three commenters, all of whom stated  that this exception \nshould be added to the final rule. (ID-0187.1; - 0205.1; -0213.1.) Accordingly, OSHA has included the exception \nin Sec.   1926.1423(h)(2) of the final rule. Paragraph (i) [Reserved.]",

Section  1926.1423(c)(3)(i) alternatively allows \ncompliance with ISO 11660-2  because those provisions are sufficiently protective and employers also  use \nequipment built by foreign manufacturers who have been following  that standard.     OSHA notes that \nproposed Sec.  1926.1423(c)(2)(i) \\99\\  inadvertently omitted handholds from the listed devices that must \nmeet  the criteria of SAE J185 (May 2003) or ISO 11660-2:1994(E).  Accordingly, OSHA has added handholds \nto the final rule in Sec.   1926.1423(c)(3)(i). Additionally, OSHA has replaced the word  \"requirements\" in \nproposed Sec.  1926.1423(c)(2)(i) with \"criteria\"  in the final Sec.  1926.1423(c)(3)(i). The Agency \ndetermines this  change clarifies that the listed devices must comply with the design  criteria contained in \nthe referenced standards and that, for the  purposes of Sec.  1926.1423(c)(3)(i), other provisions in the  \nreferenced standards do not apply. To illustrate, both SAE J185 (May  2003) and ISO 11660-2:1994(E) contain \nprovisions relating to the scope  of those standards. However, Sec.  1926.1400 sets forth the scope of   \nequipment covered by subpart CC (see discussion above of Sec.   1926.1400, Scope). Consequently, Sec.  \n1926.1423(c)(3)(i) requires that  steps, handholds, ladders, and guardrails/railings/grabrails on  equipment \ncovered by subpart CC (other than tower cranes) meet the  criteria for such devices in SAE J185 (May 2003) \nor ISO 11660- 2:1994(E), irrespective of the scope provisions in those consensus  standards. ----------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------      \\99\\ Proposed Sec.  1926.1423(c)(2)(i) corresponds with Sec.   \n1926.1423(c)(3)(i) in the final rule.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      Paragraph \n(c)(3)(ii) of this section requires that walking/stepping  surfaces, except for crawler treads, have slip-resistant \nfeatures/ properties (such as diamond plate metal, strategically placed grip  tape, expanded metal, or slip -\nresistant paint). Former Sec.   1926.550(a)(13)(iii) of subpart N required platforms and walkways to  have \nanti-skid surfaces. C-DAC recommended that OSHA retain this  requirement as a complement to the use of \nguardrails, handholds,  grabrails, ladders and other engineered safety features that are  required by new Sec.  \n1926.1423. OSHA concludes that compliance with  this provision will minimize the number of slips and falls \nfor  employees who must travel point to point to access the operator  workstations on equipment covered \nby this section.     Paragraph (c)(4) of this section applies to fall protection on  tower cranes. For the same \nreasons explained above with respect to  Sec.  1926.1423(c)(3), Sec.  1926.1423(c)(4) likewise only applies \nto  tower cranes manufactured more than one year after the effective date  of this standard. Such equipment \nmust be equipped so as to provide safe  access and egress between the ground and the cab, machinery \nplatforms,  and tower (mast), by the provision of devices such as steps, handhold s,  ladders, and \nguardrails/railings/grabrails. In the preamble to the  proposed rule, OSHA stated the Agency's intent to include \na requirement  to provide safe access and egress on tower cranes, similar to the  requirement in final \nparagraph (c)(3) to provide safe access and egress  on other equipment covered by subpart CC, and requested \npublic comment  on the issue (73 FR 59800, Oct. 9, 2008).     Three commenters responded, all stating that \nthe final rule should  include the requirement to provide safe access and egress on tower  cranes.",

This provision enables the employer to track changes in the  condition \nof the vessel from the previous inspection, thereby  correcting hazards in a timely manner. Therefore, OSHA \nis retaining  this provision in the final rule. The Agency is adding language to  paragraph (h)(6) to clarify that \nall of the inspection documentation  (including the four year inspection documentation) must be made  \navailable, for the duration of the document  retention period, to  persons performing inspections, in \naccordance with Sec.  1926.1412(k).  Paragraph (i) [Reserved.]  Paragraph (j) Working With a Diver      \nParagraph (j) of this section sets forth supplemental requirements  designed to ensure that a diver is hoisted \nsafely from the vessel and  back onto the vessel when equipment covered by this section is used for  this \npurpose. Extra precautions and meas ures are needed when engaged in  this activity due to the drowning, \nstruck-by, crushed-by, and other  hazards involved.     Marine environments and the condition of a diver \ncan change quickly  and unexpectedly; the crane/derrick operator must be constantly  aware  of the diving \noperation and in position to take immediate action when  necessary. Therefore, under proposed Sec.  \n1926.1437(j)(1), when one or  more divers are being hoisted into and out of the water, the employer  is \nprohibited from using the equipment for any other purpose until all  divers have returned back on board. This \nrequirement ensures the  operator's attention is not diverted from the welfare of the divers.  Paragraph (j)(2) \nof this section requires the equipment operator to  remain at the equipment controls during the entire diving \noperation.  This provision ensures that the operator is able to respond when  necessary.     Paragraph (j)(3) \nrequires that, in addition to the signal  requirements in Sec. Sec.  1926.1419 -1926.1422, the diver tender \nmust  be in direct communication with the equipment operator. This  communication must be done either \nthrough maintaining a clear line of  sight between the operator and tender or by electronic transmission  \nbetween the operator and tender. The tender is the individual  responsible for monitoring and communicating \nwith the diver. In this  section, the diver tender is required to maintain effective  communication with the \nequipment operator when the equipment is used to  get the diver in and out of the water. The tender is the \nmember of the  dive team who closely monitors the diver's condition during the dive  and checks the \nequipment prior to the dive. Therefore, the tender is  able to let the operator know when a diver needs to be \nlifted out of  the water or when other action by the equipment operator is needed.      Paragraph (j)(4) \nspecifies that when using a crane/derrick to hoist  a diver, the crane/derrick must be secured in such a way \nthat there is  no amount of shifting in any direction. A small shift of a crane/ derrick on a barge can result in \nmovement that can injure the diver.     OSHA notes that Sec.  1926.1431, Hoisting personnel, applies when \na  crane/derrick is used to hoist personnel. In most instances when  personnel are hoisted, they must be \nlocated in a personnel platform  that meets criteria specified in Sec.  1926.1431. However, Sec.   \n1926.1431(b)(2) contains exceptions to the use a personnel platform and  one such exception, specified by \nSec.  1926.143 1(b)(2)(iii), applies  when an employer transfers an employee to or from a marine worksite in  \na marine -hoisted personnel-transfer device. Under the definition in  Sec.  1926.1401, \"marine worksite\" \nincludes a worksite in the water;  therefore, the excepti on specified by Sec.  1926.1431(b)(2)(iii) to the  \nrequirement to use a personnel platform applies when a diver is hoisted  into or out of the water in a marine-\nhoisted personnel-transfer device.

This section address es this problem by prohibiting any part of a  crane, load or load line \n(including rigging and lifting accessories)  from being below a power line unless the employer has confirmed \nwith  the utility owner/operator that the power line is deenergized and  visibly grounded at the worksite or \nunless the employer can demonstrate  that it meets one of the four exceptions in Sec.  1926.1408(d)(2).      \nThe first exception, Sec.  1926.1408(d)(2)(i), is for work covered  by 29 CFR part 1926 subpart V. Subpart V \nwork involves work on the  power line itself and commonly requires equipment to operate below a  power \nline. As explained above with respect to Sec.  1926.1408(b)(5),  subpart V work does not require all of the \nprecautions required of  other work because the full attention of the workers is directed at the  power line.     \nThe second exception, Sec.  1926.1408(d)(2)(ii), is for equipment  with non-extensible booms and the third \nexception, Sec.   1926.1408(d)(2)(iii), is for equipment with articulating or extensible  booms. These \nexceptions apply when the uppermost part of the boom (for  non-extensible booms) or with the boom at its \nfullest extension (for  extensible booms), will be more than 20 feet below the plane of the  power line or \nmore than the Table A minimum clearance distance below  the plane of the power line at the boom's most \nvertical point.\\52\\  Where this criterion is met, it is not possible for the minimum  clearance distance to be \nbreached. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\52\\ The plane of the power line is \nthe horizontal plane that  touches the lowest point on the lowest power line. -----------------------------------------\n----------------------------------      The last exception, Sec.  1926.1408(d)(2)(iv), is for situations in  which the \nemployer can demonstrate that it is infeasible to comply with  Sec.  1926.1408(d)(1), which prohibits any \npart of a crane, load or  load line from being below a power line unless the line is deenergized  and visibly \ngrounded. Under this exception, the employer must not only  show that compliance with Sec.  \n1926.1408(d)(1) is infeasible, it must  also comply with the requireme nts in Sec.  1926.1410. Section \n1926.1410  governs equipment operations closer than the Table A minimum clearance  distances.     Two \ncommenters requested that OSHA define the term \"infeasible.\"  (ID-0203.1; -0214.1.) Infeasibility \ndeterminations are fact -dependent,  and OSHA generally considers compliance with a measure to be \ninfeasible  when it is impossible or would prevent performance of the work in  question. See OSHA CPL 02-\n00-148, ch. 5, sec. VI.B.2, Field Operations  Manual, Nov. 10, 1999. OSHA notes that this is not the first \nstandard  to incorporate feasibility considerations; the Agency has incorporated  feasibility language into \nmany other standards. See, e.g., Fall  Protection (Sec.  1926.502(k)); Permit -Required Confined Spaces (Sec.   \n1910.146(d)(5)(i)); Bloodborne Pathogens (Sec.  1910.1030(f)(3)(ii));  and Electrical Work Practices (Sec.  \n1910.333(a)(1)). In letters of  interpretation and guidance documents explaining these and other  standards, \nOSHA has elaborated on the meaning of infeasibility in  numerous factual contexts. Because infeasibility is a \nconcept of broad  applicability in the OSHA context, and its meaning depends on the  particular facts present \nin a given worksite situation, a single  definition would not provide useful guidance to employers. Accordingly,  \nthe Agency declines to adopt a definition of that term specific to  subpart CC. Paragraph (d) i s adopted as \nproposed.",

To the extent \nthis is a concern, OSHA notes that at least one  accredited testing organization allows the practical test to be  \nadministered at the employer's worksite using the employer's own  equipment. (ID-0343.) With this type of \npractical test available,  operators who feel confident that they can become certified on a  particular model \ncan be tested on that model, and such certification  will allow them to operate any model of the same type \n(as long as they  also pass the written test). Therefore, certification on a specific  model would be more \nrestrictive than is necessary, and OSHA sees no  benefit from providing for such a certification. OSHA has \ntherefore  retained the requirement that certification is ba sed on the \"type\" of  crane.     The SBREFA \nPanel also received comments from some SERs suggesting  that the standard should accommodate crane \noperators who were fully  capable of operating particular equipment in a limited set of circumstances  but \nwho wo uld be unable to pass certification tests that required knowledge  and abilities beyond those \ncircumstances. The Panel recommended that OSHA  consider and solicit public comment on expanding the \nlevels of operator  qualification/certification to allow such operators to be certified for a  specific, limited \ntype of circumstance defined by a set of parameters that,  taken together, would describe an operation \ncharacterized by simplicity and  relatively low risk. In response to the Panel's recommendation, OSHA   \nrequested public comment on whether such parameters could be identified  in a way that would result in a \nclear, easily understood provision that  could be effectively enforced.     A number of commenters were in \nfavor of a provision that would  allow certification in a limited set of circumstances. A labor  organization \nsupported certification limited to the use of rail -bound  equipment used to install continuously welded rail \nand stick rail. (ID- 0145.1.) This commenter said that such operations involved  dragging,  manipulating, and \npositioning rather than hoisting. Other commenters  also supported such a limited certification provision but \ndid not  provide specific information about how to define those operations or  what aspects of the \noperations made them less risky than other crane  operations. (ID-0151.1; -0176.1; -0191.1; -0214.1.) Other \ncommenters  opposed this type of \"restricted\" certification. (ID -0175.2; -0205.1;  -0213.1.) They said that \nthe degree of risk in a given situation was  difficult to assess and could change due to unforeseen \ncircumstances  arising on the job.      OSHA agrees with the commenters who opposed allowing a limited \nform  of certification based on perceived risk levels. As explained earlier  in the discussion of this section, the \nAgency found the argument that  certification should not be required to operate cranes that are  typically \nused for repetitive, predictable, intermittent, or light use  to be unpersuasive. OSHA did so because such uses \nare likely to involve  many if not all of the same hazards present in other situations.      Similar concerns \napply to the concept of \"low risk\" operations.  First, even if such operations could be effectively identified, the  \npossibility of unforeseen events occurring during such a lift requires  that the operator have sufficient ability \nto handle such complications.      Second, as noted above, apart from the suggestion regarding certain  \nrailroad operations, no commenter offered a means of setting the  parameters for defining this concept. OSHA \nhas therefore rejected the  concept of a limited, \"low risk\" qualification/certification.      A labor \norganization recommended that OSHA require that applicants  for certification testing provide documentation \nthat they have at least  1,000 hours of crane related on -the-job experience or training. (ID - 0341.) Such \nexperience was necessary, in this commenter's view, because  neither the written nor practical exams tested \nan operator's ability to  handle unusual worksite conditions, such as adverse weather or working  on \ncrowded jobsites, and did not test an operator's judgment.      As explained above, OSHA has included the",

To be eligible for this alternative measure,  \nemployers must use and maintain these non-approved links in compliance  with manufacturer requirements \nand recommendations. While OSHA  anticipates that NRTL -approved insulating links will be available for  \npurchase within a year after the effective date of subpart CC, the  Agency recognizes that some employers will \nhave existing inventories of  non-approved links. OSHA is, therefore, allowing employers the  additional two \nyears to phase out the use of the non-approved links to  reduce the economic burden of replacing the existing \ninventory of non- approved links.     As noted above, OSHA encourages employers to use non-approved links  \nduring the initial one-year interim period as an extra measure of  protection, but is not requiring employers \nto use them during this  interim period. The Agency recognizes that some employers might not  already own \nthese devices because OSHA did not mandate their use under  subpart N. If OSHA required the use of non -\napproved links during the  initial one -year interim period, t hese employers would be forced to  incur \nadditional costs for devices that could only be used for a fixed  period of one to three years. \\60\\ However, \nonce the NRTL-approved links  are available for purchase, the cost of purchasing the NRTL -approved  links \nwould be a capital investment that could be amortized over the  normal life of the insulating link. ---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------      \\60\\ While the record indicates that these devices are \navailable  for rental, it is not clear from the record that all employers would  have access to the businesses \nrenting these devices.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      Several commenters \nnoted the limitations of insulating links/ devices and advocated for the ability to employ alternative measures  \nwhen necessary. For example, commenters stated that no insulating  links/devices were readily available for \nloads above 60 tons or  voltages above 33 kV. (ID-0132.1; -0155.1; -0197.1.) In addition,  commenters noted \nthat the added length of rigging that results when  insulating links are used can create problems in locations \nwhere there  is limited overhead clearance. (ID -0132.1; -0155.1; -0197.1.)     Another commenter who \nmanufactures insulating links stated that  insulating links are available with lifting capacities of up to 120  \ntons and voltage capacities of up to 125 kV.\\61\\ (ID-0216.1.)  Therefore, OSHA concludes that no changes are \nnecessary to address the  objections to the proposed insulating link requirement based on load or  voltage \ncapacities. However, OSHA has concluded that some accommodation  may be necessary to address conditions \nassociated with electric utility  operations in work areas with low overhead clearance from power lines.\\62\\  \nAccordingly, OSHA has added an alternative to this provision for subpart  V operations where use of an \ninsulating link is infeasible. However, this  provision should rarely, if ever, be available to employers, as there \nare  several alternatives to using a crane or derrick in this operation including  use of an aerial lift with a \nmaterial handler or a manual hoist. The  alternative requires use of alternate electrical safety precautions;  \nspecifically, the alternate precautions are those required under the  electric power generation, transmission, \nand distribution regulations  applicable to general industry under Sec.  1910.26 9(p)(4)(iii)(B) or  (C). Those \nprecautions require either that the hoisting equipment be  insulated for the voltage involved, or that each \nemployee be protected  from hazards that might arise from equipment contact with energized  lines.\\63\\ --\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\61\\ Refer to the discussion of Sec.  \n1926.1408(b)(4)(v) for a  description of other comments received concerning insulating links  in the context \nof that provision.     \\62\\ The example provided by the commenter was replacement/ repair of utility pole \ntransformers. (ID-0155.1.) Such operations  frequently involve hoisting transformers onto and off of utility  \npoles immediately beneath power lines.

To avoid any potential ambiguity about whether  equipment \nis \"taken out of service\" when its operation is prohibited because  of an inoperational safety device, OSHA is \ninserting new text in Sec.  1926.141 5(b)  and a cross reference to Sec.  1926.1417 (Operation).

However,  the steel erection standard does not require planning or other  \nadditional precautions whenever there is a critical lift. A critical  lift plan is only required i n subpart R when \nthe employer elects to  do a site -specific erection plan as an alternative to the  requirements of Sec. Sec.  \n1926.753(c)(5), 1926.757(a)(4), or  1926.757(e)(4). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \nC-DAC identified and addressed the particular situations that  necessitate special planning and procedures \nrather than using a more  generalized \"critical lift\" approach based on a percent of rated  capacity. For \nexample, the Committee developed specific requirements  for hoisting personnel, operating equipment when \npower lines are  present, and in Sec. Sec.  1926.1417(o)(3)(ii) and 1926.1417(s), for  hoisting loads that \nexceed 75 percent of rated capacity or are 90  percent or more of rated capacity. This enabled the Committee \nto  separately address the specific hazards associated with each type of  operation. The advantage of this \napproach is that the standard's  requirements could be specifically tailored to each type of situation,  \npromoting both effectiveness and clarity. Therefore, OSHA defers to the  expertise of C-DAC and declines to \nadopt the commenters' suggestions. Paragraph (a) Plan Development     Section 1926.1432(a) requires an \nemployer to develop a plan before  beginning a crane/derrick operation in which more than one crane/ derrick \nwill be supporting the load, the operation must be planned. The  planning must meet the criteria set forth in \nSec. Sec.  1926.1432(a)(1)  through (3). The purpose of the requirement for a plan is to help  ensure that \nthe hazards involved with a multiple lift are identified and  eliminated. The Committee determined that a plan-\nbased requirement would  be the most appropriate and effective means of reducing the risks associated  \nwith these operations.     Section 1926.1432(a) does not, however, require the multiple crane/  derrick lift \nplan to be documented. One commenter suggested that the  final rule require the plan to be in writing to \nensure that the plan  would be well designed and could be clearly communicated to all  affected personnel. \n(ID-0182.1.) C -DAC carefully considered where to  recommend including documentation requirements \nthroughout the standard,  and did not recommend including one for this provision. The commenter  did not \nprovide any explanation of how a documentation requirement  would enhance the review of the plan or the \ncommunication of the plan  to the parties involved, and OSHA has decided to defer to the expertise  of the \nCommittee and declines to include a docume ntation requirement  for Sec.  1926.1432.  Paragraph (a)(3)     \nSection 1926.1432(a)(3) requires engineering expertise to be  provided by the employer whenever the \nqualified person determines that  it is necessary. One commenter believed that all multiple -crane/derrick  \nlifts should be planned by a licensed professional engineer due to the  technical complexity of such lifts. (ID-\n0156.1.) As discussed in the  preamble to the proposed rule, in the view of the Committee, some, but  not \nall, multiple -crane/derrick lifts need to be planned with  engineering expertise so that the lift can be \nperformed safely (73 FR  59841, Oct. 9, 2008). Similarly, the Committee determined that it is  not practical \nto set criteria in the rule for identifying which lifts  need such expertise. OSHA defers to the expertise of the \nCommittee on  this issue and has decided not to adopt the commenter's suggestion.  Paragraph (b) Plan \nImplementation     Under th is paragraph, the employer is required to take specific  steps designed to \nensure that the decisions and precautions built into  the plan are effectively implemented.",

See the discussion above of Sec.  \n1926.1400 regarding service trucks  with hoisting devices. As noted in the explanation of Sec.  1926.1427,  \nOSHA has modified its operator certification requirements from the  proposed rule to address certification of \noperators of equipment for  which no certification program currently exists.     Another commenter sought \nclarification on whether Sec.  1926.1438  applies to permanently installed overhead and gantry cranes \nlocated in  facilities that may also involve construction related activities. (ID- 0162.1.) As explained above, this \nsection applies to permanently  installed overhead and gantry cranes that are used in construction.  Section \n1926.1438(a) clearly states that the requirements of Sec.   1910.179, except for Sec.  1910.179(b)(1), apply \nto these cranes; in  these instances, the requirements of subpart CC would not apply.  Section 1926.1438 \ndoes not apply to permanently installed overhead and  gantry cranes that are merely located in a facility that \nmay also be  involved in construction activities. The crane itself must be used in  construction activities to \ntrigger Sec.  1926.1438.      Except as explained above, the Agency has therefore promulg ated  this \nprovision as proposed. Section 1926.1439 Dedicated Pile Drivers      This section covers equipment that is \ndesigned to function  exclusively as a pile driver, as defined in Sec.  1926.1401. Unlike the  other equipment \ncovered by this subpart, ded icated pile drivers are not  designed primarily to hoist, lower, and horizontally \nmove suspended  loads. However, the Committee decided that the scope of this standard  should cover \ndedicated pile drivers because their functions, and  related hazards, are similar to those of cranes. For a \ncomplete  discussion of the rationale for the coverage of dedicated pile drivers  by this standard, see the \ndiscussion in the proposed rule at Sec.   1926.1400, Scope (73 FR 59714, 59727-59728, Oct. 9, 2008).     As \ndiscussed below, most of the provisions of this subpart apply to  dedicated pile drivers; however, this section \nincludes provisions that  address the unique characteristics of such equipment . In addition to  the \nrequirements of this subpart, pile driving equipment continues to  be covered by Sec.  1926.603, Pile driving \nequipment.     One commenter expressed support for the inclusion of Sec.   1926.1439. (ID-0158.1.) OSHA \nreceived no public comment in opposition. Paragraph (a)     This paragraph provides that the requirements \nof subpart CC apply  to dedicated pile drivers except as noted elsewhere in this section.  The Agency changed \nthe words \"this standard\" to \"Subpart CC\" in the  final rule . With the exception of the clarification, this \nprovision is  promulgated as proposed.  Paragraph (b)     Paragraph (b) of this section provides that the \nrequirements of  Sec.  1926.1416(d)(3) do not apply to dedicated pile drivers. Section  1926.1416(d)(3) \nrequires that cranes manufactured after February 28,  1992, be equipped with anti-two-blocking devices. This \ndoes not apply  to dedicated pile drivers. As explained in the discussion of Sec.   1926.1416(d)(3), anti-two-\nblock devices are not required during pile  driving operations because the heavy repetitive forces imposed on \nsuch  devices during pile driving cause the devices to malfunction.      For discussion of alternative \nrequirements to anti -two-blocking  devices when hoisting an employee during pile  driving operations, see  \nSec.  1926.1431(p)(2). No comments were received for this paragraph; it  is promulgated as proposed.  \nParagraph (c)     Paragraph (c) of this section provides that the requirements of  Sec.",

Similarly, there are costs associated with all crane accidents,  whether or \nnot there is an employee injury. The Agency does not have  information in the record upon which to estimate \nthe overall number of  crane accidents, or the particular costs of the different types of  accidents, such as \ndropping a load, contact with power lines, and so  forth. But the Agency believes that the potential economic \nbenefits  from reducing these with compliance with the final standard  is likely  very substantial. Insurance \nSavings     An expert from the insurance industry reported that his company  offers a 10 percent reduction \nin general liability premiums if all an  employer's operators are certified. (ID-0343; -0345.34; -0347.) Several  \ncommenters confirmed that fact and also said that this saving alone  more than paid for the cost of certifying \noperators. (ID-0343.) There  was no information in the record about the cost of general liability  insurance to \nemployers with cranes, and s o the Agency cannot compute  any cost saving based on their cost or prices. \nHowever, this possible  saving clearly shows that it is not simply OSHA that sees savings  associated with \noperator certification, and that employers can  reasonably expect some im mediate savings associated with \noperator  certification (projected to cost about $51 million annually).  Net Benefits      The monetized \nbenefits and other benefits of the final standard are  estimated by the Agency to be $209.3 million annually \n($202.3 million  from fatalities and injuries avoided, plus $7 million in avoided  tipover accident costs). The \nAgency has not quantified the cost savings  from many accidents which do not involve injury that will be \nprevented  by the final standard. 5. Technological Feasibility     In accordance with the OSH Act, OSHA is \nrequired to demonstrate  that occupational safety and health standards promulgated by th e Agency  are \ntechnologically feasible. Accordingly, OSHA reviewed the  requirements that would be imposed by the final \nregulation, and  assessed their technological feasibility. As a result of this review,  OSHA has determined that \ncompliance with the requirements of the final  standard is technologically feasible for all affected industries. \nThe  standard would require employers to perform crane inspections, utilize  qualified or certified crane \noperators, address ground conditions,  maintain safe distanc es from power lines using the encroachment  \nprevention precautions, and to fulfill other obligations under the  standard. Compliance with all of these \nrequirements can be achieved  with readily and widely available technologies. Some businesses in the  \naffected industries already implement the requirements of the standard  to varying degrees (some states have \nrequirements), as noted during the  SBREFA Panel. OSHA believes that there are no technological constraints  \nin complying with any of the proposed requirements, and received no  comments that suggested that these \nstandards were technologically  infeasible. 6. Costs     The Agency received comment on some unit cost \nestimates of specific  provisions in the PEA: Operator certification, the number of crane jobs  involving work \nnear power lines, electric utilities providing voltage  information, de -energizing power lines, locking out \nautomatic line re - energizing devices, providing line wraps for power lines, and  conducting power line \nmeetings.

One commenter requested that the term \"user of the equipment\" be  defined. (ID-\n0214.1.)

For these overhead and  gantry cranes, the \nCommittee applied the safety requirements in Sec.   1910.179, which apply whether the crane is used in  \ngeneral industry or  construction, along with portions of subpart CC to address the specific  concerns about \ncranes used in construction.

Because insulating links previously have not been required by any  OSHA \nstandard, OSHA has not yet recognized any testing laboratory as a  NRTL for purposes of insulating link listing, \nlabeling, or acceptance.  A period of time will be needed to review laboratory requests for such  recognition. \nOnce there are NRTLs for testing insulating links, some  time will also be needed for the NRTLs to conduct the \ntests. As a  result, where Sec.  1926.1408(b) applies, Sec.  1926.1408(b)(4)(v) will  be unavailable as an \nadditional measure in the list contained in Sec.   1926.1408(b)(4) until employers acquire NRTL -approved \ninsulating links.

While OSHA  still intends that employees who have passed either the written exam  or \npractical test be eligible to serve as an \"operator -in- training,\" it is not including this text in the regulation \nbecause  these employees are already addressed by the language that was in  proposed paragraph (f)(1) (\"an \nemployee who is not qualified or  certified under this section\") and is included in the final rule as  the \nintroductory text for paragraph (f).   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      The \nproposed rule used the phrase \"trainee/apprentice\" to  describe an operator -in-training, the word \n\"supervisor\" to describe  the individual responsible for monitoring the operator -in-training, and  the word \n\"supervise\" to describe that individual's oversight of the  operator-in-training. Several commenters suggested \nthat the terms  \"trainee,\" \"apprentice,\" and \"supervisor\" could be construed to  have labor/management \nconsequences under the National Labor Relations  Act (NLRA). (ID -0182.1; -0199.1; -0341.0.) OSHA did not \nintend for  these terms to be construed as they are used under the NLRA, and, to  avoid any possible \nconfusion on the subject, has changed \"supervisor\"  to \"trainer,\" \"trainee/apprentice\" to \"operator -in-\ntraining,\" and  \"supervise\" to \"monitor\" in the final rule.     Paragraph (f)(1) requires that the operator-in-\ntraining be provided  with sufficient training prior to operating the equipment to enable  him/her to operate \nit safely under the limitations listed in this  section and any additional limitations established by the employer .  \nThis ensures that, before beginning to operate the equipment at the  site, the operator-in-training would have \nattained sufficient knowledge  and skills to operate the equipment safely within the limitations and  with the \nmonitoring required by the remainder of Sec.  1926.1427.      Paragraph (f)(2) restricts the operator -in-\ntraining operation of  the equipment to those tasks currently within his/her ability. As the  operator-in-\ntraining gains experience and demonstrates increased skill,  this provision allows him/her to perform \nprogressively more complex  tasks.     Paragraph (f)(3) sets forth the requirements that an employee would  \nhave to meet to be permitted to monitor the operator-in-training's  operation of the crane. During the training \nperiod, the operator-in- training must be closely monitored to ensure that he/she is operating  in accordance \nwith the training he/she has received and is adhering to  the limitation in paragraph (f)(2) that he/she only \nperforms tasks  currently within his/her ability.      Under paragraph (f)(3)(i) the operator -in-training's \ntrainer has to  be an employee or agent of the operator-in-training's employer. This  ensures that the trainer \nhas the authority to direct the actions of the  operator-in-training.     Paragraph (f)(3)(ii) requires that the \noperator-in-training's  trainer must be either a qualified/certified operator (in accordance  with Sec.  \n1926.1427), or to have passed the written portion of a  qualification/certification test under one of the \nOptions in Sec.   1926.1427. In addition, the trainer must be familiar with the proper  use of the equipment's \ncontrols. This provision is designed to ensure  that the trainer has sufficient knowledge about the equipment \nto enable  him/her to effectively oversee the safe operation of the crane.      Paragraph (f)(3)(iii) requires \nthat the trainer perform no tasks  that would detract from his/her ability to monitor the operator-in- training. \nThis provision ensures that the trainer is able to devote  sufficient attention what the operator-in-training is \ndoing so that he/  she can intervene to prevent the operator -in-training from doing  anything unsafe.",

Paragraphs (a)(4)(ii)(B) and (C) allow the \nemployer the option of  either removing the wire rope from service or to implement the measures  as \ndescribed in paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B) above. In addition, OSHA is  adding a cross-reference to Sec.  1926.1417 \n(Operation), which includes  a number of separate requirements that are triggered if the equipment  is taken \nout of service.     The proposed rule would have allowed Category II wire-rope  deficiencies \\74\\ to remain \nin service up to 30 da ys when using  specified alternative measures. Under former subpart N, these  \ndeficiencies would have resulted in removing the wire rope immediately  from service. However, OSHA relied \non C-DAC's expertise and proposed  the provision as recommended by the Committee. ----------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------      \\74\\ These measures were proposed at Sec. Sec.   \n1926.1413(a)(4)(ii)(B) and 1926.1413(a)(4)(iii).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \nThe Agency received comments regarding the alternative measures  proposed for Category II wire -rope \ndeficiencies from three commenters.  All of the commenters objected to allowing continued use of wire rope  \nwith Category II deficiencies. Two of the commenters stated that the  proposed option to continue using wire \nrope with the proposed  alternative measures relaxed both national consens us standards and the  \ninstructions of wire rope manufacturers. (ID -0122.0; -0178.1.) They  believed allowing the employer to use \nthe damaged wire rope in service  up to 30 days was a dangerous precedent because it based employee \nprotection  on conditions that could be difficult for a qualified person to assess  accurately.     The third \ncommenter (a crane manufacturer), which had a  representative on C-DAC, also objected to the continued use \nof wire  rope with Category II deficiencies. (ID-0292.1.) This commenter noted  that such deficiencies indicate \nthat the wire rope does not meet the  \"acceptable life\" criteria accepted by the wire-rope industry.  Further, \nthe commenter noted that, if the wire rope continued to be  used with the Category II deficiencies,  \"failure \ncould occur without  further indication.\"     OSHA finds these comments persuasive with respect to the \nprotection  of employee safety. The integrity of the wire rope is critical to the  safety of any lift performed by \nequipment covered by this subpart. For  example, a break in the rope can result in a dropped load which  \nendangers employees on the worksite. Based on these comments and the  requirements of former subpart N, \nOSHA is changing the requirements in  the final rule for wire rope with Category II deficiencies. The Agency  \nnotes that this revision is consistent with the requirements of former  subpart N. Accordingly, the alternative \nmeasures outlined in the  proposed rule at Sec.  1926.1413(a)(4)(iii) have been deleted and  subsequent \nparagraphs renumbered.     Paragraph (a)(4)(iii) \\75\\ applies to Category III apparent  deficiencies. Two \ncommenters suggested that Category III is unnecessary  because paragraph (a)(4)(iv)(B) is the same as for \nCategory I. (ID - 0122; -0178.1.) As noted above, the corresponding proposed provision  for Category I, \nparagraph (a)(4)(i)(B), is being changed to remove the  references to power line contact. Moreover, Category \nIII differs from  Category I because the competent person may decide that rope with a  Category I deficiency \ndoes not constitute a safety hazard and allow the  rope to continue to be used. However, rope with a Category \nIII  deficiency must either be replaced or, if the deficiency is localized  and did not result from power line \ncontact, be severed and the  undamaged part to be used. -------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------      \\75\\ This was Sec.  1926.1413(a)(4)(iv) in the proposed rule (73  FR 59930, Oct. 9, 2008). -------\n--------------------------------------------------------------------      As discussed above in relation to paragraph \n(a)(4)(i)(B), OSHA is  changing paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(B) \\76\\ to state that, if the rope is  severed and the",

Full overhead \nprotection (i.e., no  visibility through the protective cover) is allowed when conditions are  such that a full \nprotective cover is neces sary to protect employees  from falling objects.      Paragraph (e)(10) explicitly \nstates that the protection provided by  the cover is supplemental to the protection provided by hard hats--the  \nuse of hard hats does not obviate the requirement for the platform  cover.     One commenter noted that \nhaving overhead protection for employees  in the power line industry interferes with the ability to work  \noverhead, which is a routine occurrence. (ID-0144.) Additionally, at  the public hearing, a representative from \na labor union noted that  typically an overhead cover would not be used on a personnel platform  when they \nare working near power lines, as it is desirable to minimize  the amount of conductive material. (ID-0344.) The \nAgency acknowledges  that it is common for those in the power line industry to work  overhead. However, \nthe use of a personnel platform attached to a crane  is not the only means of reaching this work location. As \nnoted in Sec.   1926.1431(a), the use of a personnel platform attached to a crane is  only permitted where \nthe employer demonstrates that conventional means  of reaching the worksite, such as an aerial lift, would \nbe either more  hazardous or impossible. OSHA notes that aerial lifts are commonly used  in utility work, and \nit therefore determined that crane-suspended  personnel platforms will be used rarely in such work. OSHA \nalso notes  that paragraph (e)(10) mandates overhead protection only when an  employee is exposed to \nfalling objects, and that should not be a common  occurrence in utility work. Therefore, the Agency does not \ndetermine  that this provision needs to make special accommodation for work near  power lines. Paragraph \n(e)(10) is promulgated as proposed.     Paragraph (e)(11) requires that all edges of the platform be smooth  \nenough to prevent injury. The purpose is to protect the employee from  injuries such as lacerations and \npuncture wounds.      Paragraph (e)(12) requires conspicuous posting of a plate or other  permanent \nwritten notice on the personnel plat form listing the weight  of the platform itself and the platform's rated \ncapacity. The purpose of  the provision is to make employees aware of the platform's limits to  prevent \noverloading, which could result in structural failure of the  platform or equipment, and to facilitate compliance \nwith Sec.   1926.1431(f)(1), which prohibits loading the platform in excess of its  rated capacity.     No \ncomments were received on paragraphs (e)(11) or (e)(12); they  are promulgated as proposed. Paragraph (f) \nPersonnel Platform Loading     Paragraph (f)(1) of this section prohibits loading the platform in  excess of \nits rated capacity.     Paragraph (f)(2)(i) requires the platform to be used exclusively  for personnel hoisting \nand not for hoisting materials. However, it does  allow the necessary materials and tools for the work activity \nto be  hoisted along with the employees. Using a personnel platform to hoist  materials can lead to damage \nof the platform due to materials shifting  or excessive loading. This can subje ct the platform to structural  \nstresses that may not be visible and contribute to platform structural  failure.     Paragraph (f)(2)(ii) \nprovides an exception to paragraph (f)(2)(i)  to allow materials and tools on the personnel platform during the \ntrial  lift as long as the materials/tools are properly secured and  distributed as specified in Sec.  \n1926.1431(f)(3).     Paragraphs (f)(3)(i) and (ii) require that any materials and tools  that are on the platform \nduring the hoist be secured, and evenly  distributed within the platform itself while the platform is suspended.  \nThese precautions are designed to prevent platform tipping and injury  to employees due to movement of \nmaterials or tools during the hoist.  OSHA concludes that the combination of paragrap hs (f)(2)(ii) and (f)(3)  \nstrikes the appropriate balance by accommodating the practical  requirements of the job while reducing the \npotential for overloading.      No comments were received on paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(3); they  are \npromulgated as proposed.     Paragraph (f)(4) limits the number of employees on a personnel  platform to",

Sec.  1926.1408 through 1926.1409; and (3)  an alternative to the requirement for insulating \nlinks under Sec.  1926.1410(d)(4).      In addition, employers engaged in subpart V activities are not  \nrequired to implement certain other protective measures required by  this standard when working near power \nlines. As discussed above,  subpart V work would not be subject to the requirement for an  additional \nprotective measure from the list in Sec.  1926.1408(b)(4).  Also, subpart V work would not be subject to the \nprohibition in Sec.   1926.1408(d)(1) against equipment operating under power lines (see  discussion above \nof Sec.  1926.1408(d)(2)(i)). And Sec.   1926.1410(d)(3) provides that an employer engaged in subpart V \nwork  closer than the Table A of Sec.  1926.1408 distance is not required to  use an elevated warning line \nor barricade.     In recognition of the fact that much subpart V work necessarily  takes place on or near \nenergized power lines, employers engaged in such  work may co mply with shorter minimum clearance \ndistances than those  specified in Sec. Sec.  1926.1408 and 1926.1409: they must generally  adhere to the \nclearance distances in Table V -1 of Sec.  1926.950.  However, Sec.  1926.952(c)(2) (redesignated as Sec.  \n1926.952(c)(3) as  a result of this rulemaking) permits clearances less than those in  Table V-1 and includes \nrequirements that must be met when equipment is  operating closer to power lines that those distances. To \nmake this  clear, Sec.  1926.1410(c)(2) provides: \"Employers engaged in subpart V  work are permitted to \nwork closer than the distances in Sec.  1926.950  Table V-1 where both the requirements of this section and \nSec.   1926.950(c)(3)(i) or (ii) are met.\" \\68\\ OSHA is also making  conforming amendments to Sec.  \n1926.952(c)(3), which was formerly  designated Sec.  1926.952(c)(2).  --------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------      \\68\\ The proposed rule referred to \"Sec.  1926.950(c)(2)(iii)  or (iv).\" The final rule \nreflects the changes in numbering to Sec.   1926.950(c)(2) that are made elsewhere in this final rule. ----------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------      Under this section, the precautions previously \nspecified in  Sec. Sec.  1926.952(c)(2)(i) and (ii) are required under Sec.   1926.1410(d) when equipment \nused in subpart V work is operated closer  than the Table V-1 clearances. Since these precautions are now \nrequired  by Sec.  1926.1410(d), OSHA is deleting them from subpart V as  redundant. Therefore, OSHA is \nincluding the non -redundant provisions  from the proposed rule in the final rule, with proposed Sec.   \n1926.952(c)(2) redesignated as Sec.  1926.952(c)(3). \\69\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------      \\69\\ In subpart V, when equipment is considered energized, a  number of subpart V requirements \nare triggered.

Paragraph (r)(3)(iv) \nrequires each employee being transferred on a  marine-hoisted personnel-transfer device to wear a U.S. Coast \nGuard  personal flotation device that is approved for industrial use. The  purpose is to protect the employee \nfrom drowning if the device enters  the water, or if the employee falls or needs to jump into the water.     No \ncomments were received  on paragraphs (r)(1) --(r)(3); they are  promulgated as proposed.  Paragraph (s) \nHoisting Personnel for Storage-Tank (Steel or Concrete),  Shaft and Chimney Operations     This paragraph \nestablishes requirements when hoisting personnel in  storage-tanks (steel or concrete), shaft operations and \nchimney  operations. Use of a personnel platform, while usually feasible, is  infeasible in some circumstances \ninvolving these operations due to the  nature of the work activity. Consequently, boatswain's chairs are  \nallowed instead of a personnel platform in such instances, but only  when the employer can demonstrate that \nuse of a personnel platform is  infeasible. For these reasons, Sec.  1926.1431(s)(1) allows the  employer to \nuse a boatswain's chair only when the employer has  determined that use of a personnel platform is infeasible.     \nSection 1926.1431(s)(2) requires the employer to follow the  requirements of paragraphs (a) through (n) of \nSec.  1926.1431 when  using a personnel platform to hoist employees. Unde r Sec.   1926.1431(a), an \nemployer may only use equipment to hoist personnel  when other means of reaching the work area presents \na greater hazard or  is not possible because of the project's structural design or worksite  conditions. \nTherefore, before using a personnel platform to hoist  personnel in storage tanks (steel or concrete), shaft \noperations and  chimney operations, the employer must determine that hoisting personnel  instead of using \nother means of access to the work area is the least  hazardous, or the only, means to gain access to the work \narea.     Section 1926.1431(s)(3) establishes the requirements when the  employer uses a boatswain's chair \ninstead of a personnel platform for  hoisting personnel.     Section 1926.1431(s)(3)(i) identifies which of the \nprovisions in  Sec. Sec.  1926.1431(a) through (r) apply when using a boatswain's  chair. For the applicable \nprovisions, the phrase \"boatswa in's chair\"  is substituted for either \"personnel platform\" or \"platform.\"      \nThe Sec.  1926.1431 paragraphs not listed in Sec.   1926.1431(s)(3)(i) do not apply when a boatswain's chair \nis used. This  is because those requirements are either specifically applicable to  personnel platform design \nand use, or are otherwise not relevant when  hoisting personnel on a boatswain's chair in storage tanks (steel \nor  concrete), shaft operations and chimney operations.      Section 1926.1431(s)(3)(ii) requires the \nemployee to be hoisted in  a slow, controlled descent and ascent. This is to limit swinging or  sudden \nmovement of the boatswain's chair to prevent a fall from the  chair or impact with the walls or other areas or \nstructures involved in  these operations.     No comments were received on paragraphs (s)(1) through \n(s)(3)(ii);  they are promulgated as proposed.     Section 1926.1431(s)(3)(iii) requires the employee in the  \nboatswain's chair to use personal fall arrest equipment, including a  full body harness, that is attached \nindependent of the crane/derrick.  Having the tie off point independent of the equipment protects the  \nemployee from a sudden drop or fall due to equipment failure or other  problems associated with the \noperation of the crane/derrick, and to  protect the employee from falls when accessing and egressing the  \nboatswain's chair.     One commenter noted that in certain construction projects there is  no structure in \nplace for independent attachment of personal fall  arrest equipment. (ID-0130.l; -0343.1.)",

Section 1926.1401 Definitions      OSHA includes a number of \ndefinitions to clarify the meaning of  terms used in this subpart. Man y of the defined terms are commonly \nused  in the industry, and C -DAC in most instances relied on standard  industry sources or its own \nunderstanding of how terms are used in the  industry to help ensure that the definitions would be readily  \nunderstood by employers and employees. Industry sources on which C -DAC  relied include existing OSHA \nstandards, consensus standards, and \"A  Glossary of Common Crane and Rigging Terms\" (Specialized Carriers \nand  Rigging Foundation 1997) (\"SC&RF Handbook\") (ID-0019.). OSHA includes  other definitions to ensure \nthat certain terms used in the proposed  standard have a precise, unambiguous meaning.      One \ncommenter noted that definitions as proposed were not identical  to those in certain consensus standards \nand requested t hey be changed  to match. (ID -0178.1.) The commenter cited to various consensus  \nstandards, including ANSI A10.31 -2006, ANSI A10.28 -1998, ANSI A10.33 - 1998, and ANSI Z359.0 -2007. The \ncommenter did not explain why the  definitions as proposed were inappropriate nor how the change would  \nimprove safety. As noted above, consensus standards were utilized as a  resource in developing the definitions \nfor this subpart. OSHA disagrees  with the commenter's position that the definition must match consensus  \nstandards. OSHA established definitions that would work in the  framework of the equipment covered by this \nsubpart, would coordinate  with other OSHA standards and provide a foundation  for enforcing the  \nrequirements of this subpart. As a result, OSHA is not making  modifications to definitions based on this \ncommenter's request.     A few definitions in this final rule have been modified from or  added to those in \nthe proposed rule. Tho se definitions are: A/D  director; Assembly/Disassembly; Builder; Controlling entity; \nDigger  derrick; Duty cycle; Freeboard; Hoist; Load moment (or rated capacity)  indicator; Load moment (or \nrated capacity) limiter; Nationally  recognized accrediting agency; Positioning device system; Range control  \nlimit device; Repetitive lift; Tower crane; Type; Upperworks; and Wire  rope.     The reasons for these \nadditions or modifications are discussed in  the preamble at the location indicated in Table 5 below, with the  \nexception of the definition for hoist, which is discussed below.      OSHA received one comment on the \ndefinition of \"hoist\" in the  proposed rule. (ID -0122.0.) This commenter expressed concern that the  \nproposed definition would exclude hoists that utilized wire rope or  chains. To address this concern, OSHA \nmodified the definition of  \"hoist\" in the final rule to refer to \"a line\" rather than  \"rope.\" The use of the more \ngeneral term \"line\" is intended to  refer to any material (e.g., rope, wire rope, chain, etc.) used to  connect \nthe hoist to that which is being hoisted.      Definitions that did not receive comment are adopted for the  \nreasons set forth in the preamble of the proposed rule (see 73 FR  59733-59739, Oct. 9, 2008).      The \npreamble location for discussion of all definitions provided in  Sec.  1926.1401 can be found in Table 5 below.",

Section \n1926.1431(o)(3) sets out additional requirements that must  be met when the employer elects to use a \nboatswain's chair instead of a  personnel platform for hoisting personnel.     Paragraph (o)(3)(i) identifies \nwhich of the provisions in Sec.   1926.1431 (a)-(n) apply when using a boatswain's chair. For the  applicable \nprovisions, the phrase \"boatswain's chair\" is substituted  for either \"personnel platform\" or \"platform.\"      \nThe Sec.  1926.1431 paragraphs not listed in Sec.   1926.1431(o)(3)(i) do not apply when a boatswain's chair \nis used. This  is because those requirements are either specifically applicable to  personnel platform design \nand use, or are otherwise not relevant when   hoisting personnel in a drill shaft.      Paragraph (o)(3)(ii) \nrequires a signal person to be stationed at  the opening of the shaft during personnel hoisting. The purpose is \nto  ensure that a signal person is used and stationed at the best position  to watch the employee being \nhoisted, since the hoisted employee is out  of the view of the operator.     Paragraph (o)(3)(iii) requires the \nemployee to be hoisted in a  slow, controlled descent and ascent. This is to limit swinging or  sudden \nmovement of the boatswain's chair to prevent a fall from the  chair or impact with the walls of the drill shaft.     \nParagraph (o)(3)(iv) requires the employee in the boatswain's chair  to use personal fall arrest equipment, \nincluding a full body harness,  that is attached independent of the crane/derrick. The purpose of  requiring \na tie off point independent of the equipment is to protect  the employee from a sudden drop or fall due to \nequipment failure or  other problem associated with the operation of the crane/derrick, and  to protect the \nemployee from falls when accessing and egressing the  boatswain's chair.     Paragraph (o)(3)(v) requires \nfall protection equipment to comply  with S ec.  1926.502, Fall protection systems criteria and practices.      \nParagraph (o)(3)(vi) requires the boatswain's chair (excluding the  personal fall arrest anchorages) to be \ncapable of supporting, without  failure, its own weight plus a minimum of five times the maximum  intended \nload. This is similar to the requirement for personnel  platforms at Sec.  1926.1431(e)(4). The strength \nrequirement applicable  to personal fall arrest anchorages is in Sec.  1926.502(d)(15).      Paragraph \n(o)(3)(vii) mandates tha t only one person can be hoisted  at a time when using a boatswain's chair. No \ncomments were received on  paragraphs (o)(1)--(o)(3); they are promulgated as proposed.  Paragraph (p) \nHoisting Personnel for Pile Driving Operations      This paragraph provides requirements for hoisting \npersonnel in pile  driving operations. Section 1926.1431(p)(1) requires the employer to  use either a \npersonnel platform or boatswain's chair when hoisting  personnel in pile driving operations. As with drill shafts, \nuse of a  personnel platform will often be infeasible in this type of operation,  and Sec.  1926.1431(p)(1) \ngives the employer the option of choosing  which method to use. No comments were received on this \nprovision; it is  promulgated as proposed.     Section 1926.1431(p)(2) delineates the alternatives to using \nan  anti two-blocking device during pile driving operations, since the  heavy vibrations of the pile driver \ntypically damage this device. (See  Sec.  1926.1431(d)(45)(v), Anti two -block). The language C -DAC  \ndeveloped for this provision did not distinguish between lattice boom  cranes and telescopic boom cranes.",

(OSHA -S030A-2006- 0064-0019.) Mr. Daniel also \nstated that no costs were included for re- testing or loss of production. However, the Agency did include costs  \nfor re-testing (when an operator initially fails the test) and the  value of lost production is accounted for in \noperator's wages. Several  participants in the SBAR panel also noted that they have no turnover  among their \ncrane operators.     Current OSHA standards require operators of construction cranes to  ensure that \noperators are trained. The Agency does not agree that the  final standard requires a five-day training and prep \ncourse for  employees to take and pass the crane operator's certification. Five-day  courses are designed not \njust to prepare potential operators for  certification, but to train newcomers. For example, Bob Behlman of  \nBehlman Builders in describing the training that he sends his crane  operator to, notes that the five-day course \nby a national consulting  firm that specializes in mobile crane training and inspection services  is \"designed \nfor both newcomers to the crane operators field [and] to  those who have years of experience.\" (ID-0373.1.) \nMr. Behlman notes  that the current five-day course that he provides for his crane  operators as of this time \nstill does not include a written and  practical test, such as NCCCO or the Internat ional Union of Operating  \nEngineers (IUOE) offers. As Mr. Brent of NCCCO said at the public  hearing, \"a lot of those costs * * * are not \nassociated with  certification at all. They're associated with the training process.\"  (ID-0343.)     Many \ntesting companies provide testing along with a preparation in  either two-day or five-day courses, but virtually \nall commenters on the  record note that few certified operators take the preparation course  when re -\ncertifying is done, and that re-certification is much less  costly. The preparation course is designed not to train \noperators on  cranes, but to help them negotiate the written t est. Again, as noted  above, the Agency was \nnot including in its estimates of the cost of  operator certification any training related to obtaining knowledge  \nabout, or operating, a crane, which is already a duty of operators of  cranes in construction. Operators have \nbeen taking certification exams  without benefit of special preparatory courses for many years in cities  and \nstates (such as Connecticut and New York City) that perform their  own testing of crane operators for licensing \nor certification. As was  pointed out in testimony, part of the resistance to third-party  certification may be \nthat current crane operators may lack the  requisite training or skills. (ID -0343.)     It was not incumbent \nupon the Agency to include purchased,  preparatory training from third party providers as a cost of the  \nstandard. The final standard requires no such purchased training. The  Agency concludes that while many \nemployers and crane operators will  avail themselves of the test preparation, not all will do so, and this  was \nrecognized in comment. (ID-0343.) In terms of estimating the costs  of the final standard, it is reasonable that \nemployees and independent  crane operators, who have already been sufficiently trained in crane  operation \nand may have many years' experience, certainly need no more  than a short preparation to successfully pass \nthe crane operator  certification tests. Thus, the Agency has included as part of the cost  of the standard, \n$1,500 as the price of a two-day prep course for  taking the operator's written and hands-on exams.     The \nAgency did not include costs of operator certification for  users of sideboom cranes found in pipeline \nconstruction (NAICS 237120  Oil and Gas Pipeline Construction) and derricks, found in water tank  \nconstruction (NAICS Water and Sewer Line Construction). Both types of  cranes are exempted from \nrequirements for operator certification in the  final standard.     The Agency increased t he number of \ncurrent crane operators in  construction who already are certified. NCCCO reported that since 1996  they \nhad provided exams for 65,000 operators who had taken over 365,000  exams. (Operators frequently choose \nto be certified on several  different types of cranes. (ID-0343.)) NCCCO reported that crane  certification was \nprimarily sought for construction cranes. The IUOE  reported that they have provided 12,000 written and",

Sec.   1926.856(c) and 1926.858(b), do not change any existing rights or  obligations, \nand no member of the regulated community is likely to  object to it. OSHA, therefore, finds good cause that \nthe opportunity  for public comment is unnecessary within the meaning of 5 U.S.C.  553(b)(3)(B), 29 U.S.C. \n655(b), and 29 CFR 1911.5.  Subpart V--Power Transmission and Distribution  Amendment to Sec.  1926.952      \nThe subpart V provisions have been changed to reflect the  terminology used in the scope section of this \nstandard and its new  subpart designation. Accordingly, Sec.  1926.952( c), which referenced  subpart N \nwith respect to derrick trucks and cranes, has been revised  to reference subpart CC. Prior to this final rule, \nSec. Sec.   1926.952(c)(1)(i) and (ii) addressed minimum clearance distances.  Because Sec.

One commenter suggested that paragraph (e)(6)(v) be modified to  \nmake it clear that the qualified person performing the estimate of the  wind speed must be located at the \nsame height as the operator of the  crane. (ID-0199.1.) OSHA does not determine such a change is needed.  \nFirst, the operator's station is not always at the level of the jib; in  some cranes the operator cab is well below \nthe jib, and in others the  operator may even be at ground level. Second, a qualified person is  expected to \nuse his or her judgment and expertise to perform numerous  functions throughout this rule, and OSHA \nconcludes that the qualified  person at the site is best able to determine how best to estimate the  wind \nspeed if called upon to do so under th is paragraph.     Section 1926.1435(e)(6)(vi) requires tower cranes \nmanufactured more  than one year after the effective date of this standard to have a  device that displays \nthe magnitude of the load on the hook. This could  be either a separate device or one that is part of the load \nmoment  limiting device (discussed above) that displays magnitude of the load  on the hook. By informing \nthe operator of the weight of the load, this  device helps the operator ensure that the crane is operated within \nits  rated capacity. The temporary alternative is for the weight of the load  to be determined from a source \nrecognized by the industry (such as the  load's manufacturer), by a calculation method recognized by the  \nindustry (such as calculating the weight a steel beam from measured  dimensions and a known per foot \nweight), or by other equally reliable  means. This information must be provided to the operator prior to the  \nlift. The proposed rule had provided that the weight of the load and  calculations be based on a \"reliable \nsource.\" To avoid the  potentially subjective interpretations of \"reliable,\" OSHA is instead  requiring in the \nfinal rule that these be from a source typically  relied on in the industry.     One commenter believed that \nmost of the operational aids listed in  this section are so vital to safe operation that the crane should not  be \noperated if they are not functioning properly. (ID -0172.1.) In  effect, this commenter would convert these \ndevices from operational  aids to safety devices. This commenter also believed the time period  for other \noperational aids to be repaired should be shortened.      It was C -DAC's considered judgment that safety \nwould not be  compromised if the employer follows the temporary alternative meas ures  specified for the \nvarious operational aids and that the time periods  for getting malfunctioning devices repaired was reasonable. \nThis  commenter has offered no basis for OSHA to override C-DAC's judgment on  these issues. Paragraph (f) \nInspections     Proposed paragraph (f)(1) of this section did not state that Sec.   1926.1413 (Wire rope--\ninspection) applies to tower cranes. OSHA notes  that the wire rope inspections required under Sec.  \n1926.1413 must also  be conducted for tower cranes and determines it is useful to reference  all tower crane \ninspection requirements in Sec.  1926.1435(f).  Therefore, OSHA modified Sec.  1926.1435(f)(1) of the final \nrule to  specify that 1926.1413 applies to tower cranes.     Under paragraph (f)(1), the post-erection, shift, \nmonthly, and  annual inspections required under Sec. Sec.  1926.1412 and 1926.1413  must be conducted \nfor tower cranes.     Proposed paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) specified additional  requirements for the post-\nerection and monthly inspections for  tower  cranes beyond those required under Sec.  1926.1412. OSHA \nreceived no  comments objecting to those requirements but did receive comments  suggesting that a pre-\nerection inspection should be required and  recommending that additional items be included in the monthly  \ninspection. OSHA will first address the pre-erection inspection issue.     Two commenters and witnesses at \nthe hearing urged OSHA to add a  requirement for a pre-erection inspection of the crane's component  parts. \n(ID-0182.1; -0199.1.)",

(ID- 0132.1.) OSHA concludes that the competent person or persons who  conduct shift \nand monthly inspections, and the qualified person who  conducts annual inspections, must have access to all \nwritten documents  produced under this section so that they are made aware of any  components of the \nequipment that may require special attention during  their inspections.     Accordingly, OSHA is adding a \nnew paragraph (e) at the end of Sec.   1926.1413 that specifies that all documents produced under this \nsection  must be available to all persons who conduct inspections under this  section. Paragraph (b) Monthly \nInspection     Proposed paragraph (b) required a monthly inspection of wire rope  that would be, in both \nthe level of scrutiny and the expertise required  of the inspector, a documented shift inspection.      A \ncommenter pointed out that paragraph (c)(3)(ii) requires that  certain deficiencies identified during the annual \ninspection must be  monitored during the monthly inspection and suggested that this  requirement be \nspecifically stated in paragraph (b). (ID-0226.) OSHA  agrees and is adding paragraph (b)(2), which states that \nthe inspection  must include any deficiencies identified in the annual inspection as  needing to be monitored. \nParagraph (c) Annual/Comprehensive     Proposed Sec.  1926.1413(c) required an annual inspection (at \nleast  every 12 months) for wire rope, conducted by a qualified person. The  annual inspection would be \nconsiderably more thorough and comprehensive  than the shift and monthly inspections required by \nparagraphs (a) and  (b) of this section. In addition, it would be conducted by a  \"qualified person,\" who would \nhave greater expertise than the  \"competent person\" who must conduct the shift and monthly  inspections. \nThe timing and inspector qualifications for the annual  wire rope inspection coincide with those for the general \nequipment  annual/comprehensive inspection. C-DAC believed that the use of  corresponding timeframes \nand personnel will allow inspections to be  conducted efficiently and thereby promote effectiveness and \ncompliance.     Under proposed paragraph (c)(1), all apparent deficiencies and  critical review items \nrequired to be checked in a shift inspection  would have to be checked in the annual/comprehensive \ninspection (see  paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3)). No comments were received on this  provision, and it is being \npromulgated as proposed.      Proposed paragraph (c)(2) provided for a more thorough inspection  than \nthat required under paragraph (c)(1). Under proposed paragraph  (c)(2), a complete and thorough inspection, \ncovering the surface of the  entire length of the wire ropes, would be required. One commenter,  which had \nnominated a member of C -DAC, stated that the entire length of  the rope needed to be inspected more \nfrequently than annually and  suggested that this requirement should be included in the monthly  inspection \nprovision. (ID-0 292.1.) This commenter did not provide any  evidence to support this assertion or explain why \nit was deviating from  the position its nominee took in favor of the provision in the C-DAC  negotiations. This \ncomment is accorded diminished weight in light of  this inconsistency of position. OSHA defers to the expertise",

An exception is provided in limited \nconditions that do  not pose hazards for employees with respect to the use of older  equipment \nmanufactured before October 31, 1984.

(ID -0062.1; -\n0162.1.) OSHA agrees with  these comments. Although rubber insulating matting is des igned for use  as a \nfloor covering, the Agency determines that such mats can provide  an additional measure of protection for \nworkers operating the equipment  from the ground.\\64\\ OSHA has amended paragraph (d)(9) accordingly. ---\n------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\64\\ The proposed revision of subpart V also \nproposed a new  construction standard for electrical protectiv e equipment, which  would cover rubber \ninsulating matting. Until the subpart V revision  is finalized, rubber insulating matting meeting ASTM D178 -\n01(2005)  Standard Specification for Rubber Insulating Matting, meets the  requirement in final Sec.  \n1926.1410(d)(9) for insulating mats.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  Paragraph \n(d)(10)     Under paragraph (d)(10) of this section, only personnel essential  to the operation are permitted \nto be in the area of the equi pment and  the load. In conjunction with Sec. Sec.  1926.1410(d)(8) and  \n1926.1410(d)(9), this minimizes the likelihood that any more employees  than are absolutely necessary to the \noperation would be in a position  to make electrical contact with the equipment in the event the  equipment, \nload or load line makes electrical contact with the power  line. No comments were submitted on this provision; \nit is promulgated  as proposed. Paragraph (d)(11)     Under paragraph (d)(11) of this section, the equipment \nmust be  properly grounded. As described in the summary and explanation of final  Sec.  1926.1408(a)(2)(i) \nOption (1), in the event the equipment  inadvertently makes electrical contact with the power line, proper  \ngrounding will protect employees in two ways. First, if the line is  equipped with a circuit interrupting device, \nthe grounding facilitates  the operation of the device to deenergize the line. However, under some  \nconditions, for example, if there is arcing contact or if the contact  is near the end of a power line, the fault \ncurrent may not be high enough  to open the circuit for the power line. Second, in the event an employee  \non the ground is touching the equipm ent when it contacts the power line or  if the circuit protective device \ndoes not operate to deenergize the power  line, proper grounding will reduce the danger to the employee by  \nproviding an additional, low resistance path to ground for the electric  current, substantially lowering the \nvoltage on the equipment while the  power line remains energized.\\65\\ ------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------      \\65\\ It should be noted that hazardous potential differences can  be created in the \nground when a contact occurs, and employees  standing close to, but not touching, anything in contact with \nthe  power line can still be injured or killed. The requirements in Sec.   1926.1425, Keeping clear of the load, \nwhich are designed to p rotect  employees from being struck or crushed by hazards, will also protect  \nemployees from these electrical hazards.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \nCommenters on this provision stressed the need for worke r training  on proper equipment grounding \nprocedures and the limitations of the  protection that grounding provides. (ID -0131.1; -0155.1; -0161.1.) \nOSHA  agrees. As discussed under Sec.  1926.1408(g), OSHA is requiring that  the training under that \nparagraph include training in proper grounding  procedures and the limitations of the protection grounding \nprovides. To  make clear that the training required under Sec.  1926.1408(g) is also  required under this \nsection, OSHA is adding Sec.  1926.1410(m),  discussed below, to require that operators and crew assigned \nto  equipment under this section be trained in accordance with Sec.   1926.1408(g). Section \n1926.1410(d)(11) is promulgated as proposed. Paragraph (d)(12)     Under paragraph (d)(12) of this section, \ninsulating line hose or  cover-up must be installed by the utility owner/operator except where  such devices \nare unavailable for the line voltages involved.",

As a result, requiring such a finding would  be a formality that would \nnot add to worker safety.      It is similarly inappropriate to require a showing that it is  infeasible to \ndeenergize and ground the lines or relocate the lines  under paragraph (b) of this section for subpart V work. \nSubpart V  provides for deenergizing and grounding as an alternative to live line  precautions, but it also \nrecognizes that subpart V work may take place  on live line s to avoid power disruptions to the utility's \ncustomers and  includes precautions for such live line work. Thus, subpart V leaves to  the utility employer \nthe discretion to decide whether to deenergize and  ground without the need for an infeasibility \ndetermination, and OSHA  concludes they should continue to have this same discretion under this  final rule. \nOSHA also notes that paragrap h (b) of this section requires  the employer to consult with the utility \nowner/operator before deciding  that it infeasible to deenergize and ground the lines or relocate them,  and \nit would be anomalous to apply this provision where the utility  owner/operator is itself the employer .     \nFor these reasons, OSHA has modified Sec.  1926.1410(c)(2) of the  final rule to clarify that paragraphs (a),(b), \nand (c)(1) of Sec.   1926.1410 do not apply to work covered by subpart V of 29 CFR 1926.  Instead, the Sec.  \n1926.950 Table V-1 minimum clearances apply. Section  1926.1410(c)(2) also explains that employers engaged \nin subpart V work  may work closer than the Sec.  1926.950 Table V -1 distances where both  the \nrequirements of Sec.  1926.1410 and Sec.  1926.952(c) (3)(i) or (ii)  are met.\\58\\ -----------------------------------\n----------------------------------------      \\58\\ OSHA is in the process of updating subpart V requirements.  If the \nAgency makes changes to those provisions that necessitate  updating the cr oss-references in Sec.  \n1926.1410(c)(2), those  changes will be made as part of that rulemaking. -----------------------------------------------\n----------------------------      See discussion later in this section regarding other provisions in  Sec.  \n1926.1410 that deal specifically with subpart V work.  Paragraph (c) Minimum Clearance Distance     After \nthe employer makes the infeasibility determinations required  by Sec.  1926.1410(a) and (b), a minimum \nclearance distance must be  established. Under Sec.  1926.1410(c)(1), the employer can establish  this \ndistance by either having the utility owner/operator determine the  minimum clearance distance that must \nbe maintained or by having a  registered professional engineer who is a qual ified person with respect  to \nelectrical transmission and distribution determine the minimum  clearance distance that must be maintained. \nThe Committee believed that  either of these sources of this information has sufficient expertise to  \naccurately apply  the factors discussed below in setting an appropriate  minimum clearance distance.      \nCommenters objected to requiring the utility owner/operator to be  involved in setting the minimum \nclearance distance. (ID-0161.1; - 0162.1.) However, paragraph (c) of this section does not require the  utility \nowner/operator to establish the minimum clearance distance. It  gives the employer the option of engaging \nthe utility owner/operator  for this purpose but, if the utility owner/operator declines, the  employer must \nengage a registered professional engineer who is a  qualified person with respect to electrical transmission \nand  distribution. In no case is the utility owner/operator required to  establish the minimum clearance \ndistance.     Under Sec.  1926.1410(c)(1 ), regardless of whether it is the  utility owner/operator or a \nregistered professional engineer that makes  this determination, several factors must be considered when  \nestablishing the minimum clearance distance. These factors include, but  are not limit ed to: conditions \naffecting atmospheric conductivity; time  necessary to bring the equipment, load and load line (including \nrigging  and lifting accessories) to a complete stop; wind conditions; degree of  sway in the power line; \nlighting conditions, and other conditions  affecting the ability to prevent electrical contact.",

However, adding flags to those trees would be \nsufficient  because the flags would serve as a reminder that the trees are located  along a boundary that the \noperator must not breach.     The boundaries must mark the limits of all crane movement. For  example, a \nwork zone could be defined by demarcating boundaries: (1) To  the left and right of the operator, to limit the \nlateral movement of  the boom, and (2) in front of the operator, in a line connecting the  side boundaries, \nlimiting the boom's radius.     In identifying the work zone, the employer must consider the entire  area in \nwhich the crane will need to operate.

The Agency had comment in the record that newer \narticulating  cranes for building material supply are equipped with AOPDs, but the  Agency concludes that \nthere are still older models of articulating  cranes making building supply deliveries, and that these affected  \nemployers would be covered by the standard--chiefly by the requirement  for operator certification.     The \nelectric utility industry made several comments to the record.  (ID-0144; -0155.1; -0163.1; -0200; -0203.1; -\n0213; -0215; -0226; - 0345.17; -0408.1.) This industry is affecte d by the standard both  because they have \ndigger derricks and other cranes that perform  construction work from time to time, and because utilities \nmust provide  voltage information and participate in meetings with contractors to  determine power line \nsafety. Although digger derricks are exempted from  the final standard for all work on utility poles, several \ncommenters  made clear that they are routinely used for lifting in other work  settings (ID-0328.1; -0344). \nFor construction crane activities by  electric utilities, the main impact of the final standard is to require  that \noperators be certified, as all linemen currently received  extensive training in crane safety practices and \nprocedures otherwise  (ID-0155.1; -0344; -0345.17). The Agency also learne d through comment  that the \ntelecommunications industry uses digger derricks and truck- mounted cranes, and this industry is included in \nthe standard's  industry profile as well.      The Federal Railroad Agency has jurisdiction over most of the \nwork  done by railroads. The Agency has concluded that railroads will not be  affected by the final standard.     \nAll of the affected general industry sectors have been added to the  industry profile in the category of \nemployers who \"Own but do not  Rent.\" With respect to the industries not included in the PEA, the  Agency \nhas taken a conservative approach to not underestimate costs,  and therefore economic impacts, on these \nsectors. The traditional  construction industry sectors have remained unchanged. The data for all  sectors has \nbeen updated with information from the 2007 Economic  Census, 2006 County Business Patterns, and 2006 \nStatistics for U.S.  Businesses for number of firms, establishments, and revenues. Table B -2  presents \ninformation about the affected industry sectors: the number of  affected establishments, employees, industry \nprofit rates, and average  revenues and profits for affected establishments.  Estimating the numbe r of \nestablishments and cranes covered by the  standard in general industry      To estimate the number of \nestablishments and cranes in general  industry sectors affected by the final cranes standard, the Agency  \nrelied on: comment in the record; 2006 CPB a nd SUSB, and occupational  data from the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics' Occupational and Employment  Statistics, May, 2008 Occupational Employment and Wage \nEstimates,  extracted from 4 -digit NAICS industry -specific estimates (Nov. 4, 2009  from \nhttp://bls.gov/oes/oes_dl.htm). The Agency's purpose in  estimating the number of cranes in the affected \ngeneral industry  sectors is to estimate the costs employers will bear and demonstrate  that the standard is \neconomically feasible. For some industries below,  the Agency's estimates are certainly high--overestimates, \nbut the  ultimate purpose here is not to predict or forecast cost estimates, but  to show that even if more \ncranes are affected and more costs result  from the final standard, the standard is still economically feasible.  \nIn addition, since economic impacts are measured as the costs for  affected employers, the total number of \naffected cranes in a sector  does not alter the measure of impact on an affected employer. Although  a higher \ntotal number of cranes in a sector obviously changes the  estimated total cost of the entire standard. For \nexample, if an average  employer in the industry sector has 10 emplo yees and the Agency  estimates one \ncrane and one crane operator, it does not affect how  economic impact is measured whether there is one \ncrane in the industry  or 50. The impact of costs as a fraction of revenues and profits are,  on average, the \nsame for each affected employer. As a result, though  the Agency will try to estimate the number of affected",

For example, the \nArmy Corps of Engineers, in its 2008 U.S. Army Corps  of Engineers Safety and Health Requirements Manual, \ndefines \"critical  lift\" as \"a non-routine crane lift requiring detailed planning and  additional or unusual safety \nprecautions.\" This manual describes  critical lifts, in part, as lifts: (1) In which the load weighs 75% of  the \nrated capacity of the crane; in which the load is out of the  operator's view; involving more than one crane; \ninvolving non-routine  or technically difficult rigging arrangement; hoisting personnel with a  crane or derrick; \nor that the crane operator believes should be  considered critical. EM 385 -1-1, pg. 293. The National \nAeronautics and  Space Administration's definition is different:      Critical lifts are lifts where failure/loss \nof control could  result in loss of life, loss of or damage to flight hardware, or a  lift involving special high \ndollar items, such as spacecraft, one- of-a-kind articles, or major facility components, whose loss would  have \nserious programmatic or institutional impact. Critical lifts  also include the lifting of personnel with a crane, \nlifts where  personnel are required to work under a suspended load, and  operations with special personnel \nand equipment safety concerns  beyond normal lifting hazards.

When there are multiple  destination locations from a single set-up point, the trial lift \nmust  be conducted in one of two ways.     First, individual lifts may be conducted in which the platform is  \nmoved to one of the end points from the starting point, returned to the  starting point, moved to a second \nend point, again returned to the  starting point, and the process repeated until each end point has been  \nreached. Alternatively, a single lift may be conducted from the  starting point to all of the end points in \nsequence, without returning  to the starting point until after the last end point has been reached.     OSHA \ndetermined that the phrase \"a single trial lift for all  locations\" in the text of the proposed rule for Sec.  \n1926.1431(h)(1),  based on C-DAC consensus language, was not sufficiently clear to  describe the intended \nmeaning of this requirement (see 73 FR 59714,  59940-59941, Oct. 9, 2008). In addition, OSHA was concerned \nthat  allowing the trial lift to be conducted in either of these two ways,  irrespective of how the personnel \nwill actually be hoisted, may result in the trial lift failing to reveal problems that would be  encountered in the \nactual personnel lift.      To address these concerns, OSHA suggested language in the preamble  to the \nproposed rule to clarify that the employer must use a lift path  and sequence of stops in the trial lift that will \nmatch the lift path  and sequence of stops when actually hoisting personnel. As noted above,  the purpose \nis to detect any problems that could arise before personnel  are hoisted. OSHA asked for public comment on \nthese issues and the  suggested language (73 FR 59714, 59833, Oct. 9, 2008).      Two commenters stated \nthat the language in the proposed rule was  sufficient and should not be changed (ID -0205.1; -0213.1); \nanother  commenter stated that the text suggested by OSHA in the preamble to the  proposed rule should \nbe used in the final rule (ID-0104.1). The Agency  concludes this suggested text provides a better description \nof what  needs to be done to ensure safety--i.e., that the trial lift method  needs to match the actual hoist \nmethod. Therefore, the provision in the  final rule includes this suggested language.      Paragraph (h)(2) \nrequires the trial lift to take place immediately  prior to each shift when hoisting personnel, and each time the  \nequipment is moved and set up in a new location or a previously used  location. This is to ensure that the \nconditions for the trial lift will  be nearly identical to those of the actual personnel lift.  Additionally, a trial \nlift must be done each time the lift route is  changed, unless a competent person determines the new lift route \ndoes  not present new factors affecting safety.     Paragraph (h)(3) requires a competent person to ensure \nthat all  required safety devices and operational aids required by this section  are activated and properly \nfunctioning, that nothing interferes with  the equipment or personnel platform during the trial lift, t hat the  \nlift load does not exceed 50 percent of the equipment's rated capacity,  and that the load radius used is \naccurately determined. These  requirements ensure that necessary safety measures are in place and  \nvalidated by a competent person for the trial lift. It is important for  this to be the responsibility of a competent \nperson because such a  person not only has the knowledge necessary to make the determinations,  but also \nhas the authority to take any necessary corrective action.      Paragraph (h)(4) establishes the duties of the \ncompetent person  immediately after the trial lift. It requires the competent person to  conduct a visual \ninspection of the personnel platform and equipment to  determine if there is any problem or defect resulting \nfrom the trial  lift or if it produced any adverse effect. In addition, the competent  person must ensure that \nthe test weight used during the trial lift has  been removed prior to personnel loading.     The purpose of \nthese requirements is to ensure that any de fects in  the equipment, base support, or ground and personnel \nplatform, revealed  by the trial lift are seen by a competent person prior to hoisting  personnel.

On October 12,  2006, ACCSH adopted a resolution supporting the C -DAC Document and  \nrecommending that OSHA use it as the basis for a proposed standard.  (OSHA-ACCSH2006-1-2006-0198-0021.)     \nOSHA issued a proposed rule based on the C-DAC Document on October  9, 2008 (73 FR 59713, Oct. 9, 2008). \nIn reviewing the C-DAC Document  and drafting the proposed rule, OSHA ide ntified several problems in the  \nC-DAC Document. These problems ranged from misnumbering and other  typographical and technical errors, \nto provisions that appeared to be  inconsistent with the Committee's purpose, or that were worded in a \nmanner  that required clarification. The proposed rule deviated from the C-DAC  Document when revisions \nwere clearly needed to validly represent the  ommittee's purpose or to correct typographical and technical \nerrors. With  respect to substantive revisions, the Agency ide ntified and explained  these revisions in the \nportions of the preamble to the proposed rule that  addressed the affected provisions. OSHA also prepared a \ndraft of the proposed  regulatory language identifying each instance in which the proposed  rule differed \nfrom the C-DAC Document. In accordance with the ground  rules, prior to publication of the proposed rule in \nthe Federal  Register, OSHA provided the draft showing the revisions to the C-DAC  Document, along with its \ndraft of the summary and explanation of the  proposed rule, to the C -DAC members.     Additionally, the \nAgency identified other instances in which the  regulatory text drafted by the Committee did not appear to \nconform to  the Committee's purpose, or instances in which a significant issue did  not appear to have been \nconsidered by C-DAC. In these instances, OSHA  retained the regulatory language used in the C-DAC Document, \nbut asked  for public comment on whether specific revisions should be made to the  proposed regulatory \nlanguage in the final rule.      The proposed rule set a deadline of December 8, 2008, for the  public to \nsubmit comments on the proposal. At the request of a number  of stakeholders, this deadline was \nsubsequently extended to January 22,  2009 (73 FR 73197, Dec. 2, 2009). On March 17, 2009, OSHA convened \na  public hearing on the proposal, with Administrative Law Judge John M.  Vittone presiding. The hearing \nlasted four days, closing on March 20.  In addition to Jud ge Vittone, Administrative Law Judge William S.  \nColwell presided during the last part of the hearing. At the close of  the hearing, Judge Colwell established a \nposthearing comment schedule.  Participants were given until May 19, 2009 to supplement their  \npresentations and provide data and information in response to questions  and requests made during the \nhearing, make clarifications to the  testimony and record that they believed were appropriate, and submit  \nnew data and information that they considered relevant to the  proceeding. Participants also were given until \nJune 18, 2009, to  comment on the testimony and evidence in the record, including  testimony presented at \nthe hearing and material submitted during the  first part of the posthearing comment pe riod.  C. Hazards \nAssociated With Cranes and Derricks in Construction Work       OSHA estimates that 89 crane -related \nfatalities occur per year in  construction work. The causes of crane-related fatalities were recently  analyzed \nby Beavers, et al. (See J.E. Beavers, J.R. Moore, R. Rinehart,  and W.R. Schriver, \"Crane-Related Fatalities in the \nConstruction  Industry,\" 132 Journal of Construction Engin eering and Management 901  (Sept. 2006) (ID \nOSHA-2007-0066-0012 \\1\\).)

Therefore, OSHA defers to C-DAC's experience and is promulgating this  provision as proposed.     \nIt has become increasingly common for equipment to be supplied by  manufacturers with load capacities in \nelectronic form. Because of the  potential for an electronic or other failure to occur that would make  that \ninformation inaccessible, Sec.  1926.1417(c)(2) addresses a  situation in which electronic or other failure \nmakes such information  unavailable. Under this paragraph, where load capacities are available  in the cab \nonly in electronic form and a failure makes the load  capacities inaccessible, this paragraph requires that the \noperator  immediately cease operations or fol low safe shut -down procedures until  the load capacities \nbecome available again (in electronic or other  form). No comments were submitted on this provision; \ntherefore it is  promulgated as proposed. Paragraph (d)     This paragraph requires that operators refrain \nfrom engaging in any  practice that would divert their attention while operating the crane.  This includes the \nuse of cell phones except when cell phones are used  for signal communications. Operating a crane is a \ncomplex task that  requires an operator's full attention to be performed safely. This  paragraph addresses the \nrisk that an accident can occur if the  operator's full attention is not directed toward that task.      During \nthe hearing, a witness from a lumber trade association  described the practice in which the operator controls \nan articulating  boom crane with a forklift attachment via remote controls and then  assists with the off -\nloading of the materials. (ID-0341.) He expressed  concern that the operator's participation in the off-loading \nof the  crane would violate Sec.  1926.1417(d)'s prohibition on \"any practice  that diverts his/her attention \nwhile actually engaged in operating the  crane.\" (ID-0341.) As a result, his company would need to use an  \nadditional person for t he delivery, raising costs. (ID -0341.)     Section 1926.1417(d) would not necessarily \nprohibit the activity  that the witness described. If the operator uses the remote controls to  position the \narticulating crane and lock it into position before off  loading the materials, and does not simultaneously \noperate the controls  and offload the materials, the operator would not be \"actually engaged  in operating \nthe crane\" at the same time as he is off -loading the  crane. The operator would also not be considered  to \n\"leave the  equipment unattended\" so long as the operator has immediate access to  the remote controls. \nSee discussion of Sec.  1926.1417(e) below. No  other comments were submitted on this provision; therefore \nit is  promulgated as proposed. Paragraph (e) Leaving Equipment Unattended      Paragraph (e)(1) of this \nsection specifies when the operator must  be at the controls for safety-related reasons. These include making  \nnecessary adjustments to keep the load in a safe position, moving the  load where necessary for reasons of \nsafety (such as for the safety of  employees working with or near the load), and responding to emergencies  \nthat may arise during lifting operations. Previously, under 29 CFR part  1926, subpart N, the operator of a \ncrawler, locomotive, or truck crane  was prohibited from leaving the controls while a load is suspended.      \nIn the experience of C -DAC members, this requirement was routinely  breached when the load is \"held \nsuspended,\" that is, without need for  adjustment of the load's or the equipment's position for an extended  \nperiod. In such circumstances, the operator does not need to manipulate  the controls for the period of time \nthat the load is suspended and it  was a common practice for the operator to leave the controls. To  address \nthis problem, C-DAC proposed that OSHA establish criteria that  allow the operator to leave the controls when \nit is safe to do so  rather than to simply continue the existing rule unchanged. (Note that  the suspension of \nworking gear, such as slings, spreader bars, ladders,  and welding machines, is addressed separately in Sec.   \n1926.1417(e)(2).)     Several commenters from the materials delivery industry noted that  various types of \nequipment in that industry can be operated by remote  control and expressed concern that Sec.",

For those words, the definitions in  Sec.  1926.1401 apply. \nOnly three terms are defined in both Sec.   1926.1401 and Sec.  1910.179: \"hoist,\" \"load,\" and \"runway.\"      \nWith respect to \"hoist\" and \"load,\" the definiti ons in  Sec. Sec.  1926.1401 and 1910.179(a) are similar but \nworded  differently. \"Hoist\" is defined in Sec.  1926.1401 as \"a mechanical  device for lifting and lowering \nloads by winding rope onto or off a  drum.\" In Sec.  1910.179, \"hoist\" is defined as \"an apparatus which  \nmay be part of a crane, exerting a force for lifting and lowering.\"  \"Load\" is defined in Sec.  1926.1401 as \"the \nobject to be hoisted  and the weight of the object being lifted or lowered, including the  weight of the load-\nattaching equipment such as the load block, ropes,  slings, shackles, and any other ancillary equipment.\" \nSection 1910.179  defines \"load\" as \"the tot al superimposed weight on the load block  or hook.\" In both \ncases, the Sec.  1926.1401 definition is clearer and  more precise.     With respect to \"runway,\" the Sec.  \n1926.1401 and Sec.  1910.179  definitions address different subject matter. The definiti on in Sec.   \n1926.1401 addresses the criteria for a ground surface used as a path of  travel for a mobile crane traveling \nwith a suspended personnel  platform. The definition in Sec.  1910.179 refers to the rails, beams,  and other \nstructural components al ong which an overhead or gantry crane  travels. Because the Sec.  1926.1401 \ndefinition of \"runway\" does not  pertain to overhead and gantry cranes, the Sec.  1910.179 definition  \napplies under this section.      Paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C) limits the applicatio n of Sec.   1910.179(b)(2) to \nequipment identified in Sec.  1926.1438(b)(1) that  was manufactured before September 19, 2001. Section \n1910.179(b)(2)  requires cranes manufactured after August 31, 1971, to comply with the  design \nspecifications in American National Standard Safety Code for  Overhead and Gantry Cranes, ANSI B30.2.0 -\n1967. As discussed below,  equipment manufactured after September 19, 2001, must comply with the  \nupdated provisions of ASME B30.2 -2001.",

Paragraph (d)(3) requires that all of \nthe safety devices listed in  Sec.  1926.1435(d)(2) be in proper working order for the crane to be  operated. \nWhere a device stops working properly during operations, the  operator would have to safely stop operations, \nand operations are  prohibited from resuming until the device is once again in proper  working order.

Paragraphs (e)(2)(i)(A) through (D) require base-mounted \ndrum  hoists to meet requirements in specified sections of ASM E B30.7-2001.  Paragraph (e)(2)(i) does not \napply to other types of hoists. No  comments were received on these provisions and the provisions are  \nadopted as proposed.     Paragraph (e)(2)(ii), Load tests for new hoists, outlines the  requirements for load \ntesting new hoists used with a derrick. The  employer must ensure that new hoists are load tested to a \nminimum of  110% of rated capacity, but not more than 125% of rated capacity,  unless otherwise \nrecommended by the manufacturer. This requirement is  met where the manufacturer has conducted this \ntesting. ASME B30.7 -2001,  in section 7 -2.2.2(a), requires similar testing but requires the test  to be \nconducted by the manufacturer. OSHA recognizes that the  manufacturer will usually be the party who \nconducts the test and allows  the manufacturer to do so, but paragraph (e)(2)(ii) permits the test to  be \nconducted by any party as long as it is performed correctly. This  paragraph received no comments and it is \nadopted as proposed.     Paragraph (e)(2)(iii), Repaired or modified hoists, outlines the  requirements for \nuse of a hoist that has been repaired or modified. If  a hoist has had repairs, modifications or additions that \naffect its  capacity or safe operation it must be evaluated by a qualified person  to determine if a load test is \nnecessary If a load test is necessary,  load testing must be conducted in accordance with paragraphs (e)(2)(ii)  \nand (iv). This requirement parallels section 7-2.2.2(b)(1) of ASME  B30.7-2001. OSHA received no comments \non this provision and it is adopted  as proposed.     Paragraph (e)(2)(iv), Load test procedure, outlines how \ntests  required by paragraphs (e)(2)(ii) or (iii) must be conducted. Under  paragraph (e)(2)(iv)(A) the test load \nmust be hoisted a vertical  distance to assure the load is supported by the hoist and held by the  hoist brakes. \nParagraph (e)(2)(iv)(B) requires the test load to be  lowered, stopped and held with the brake(s). These \nprovisions are  comparable to section 7 -2.2.2(b)(2) of ASME B30.7 -2001.     Paragraph (e)(2)(iv)(C) states \nthat the hoist must not be used  unless a competent person determines that the test has been passed.  ASME \nB30.7-2001 does not specify who must determine if a hoist passes  its load test. C-DAC concluded, however, \nthat to ensure the load test  is properly assessed, this determination needs to be made by a  competent \nperson. The requirement that a competent person determine  whether the hoist has passed  a load test is \nconsistent with the  requirement, discussed below under Sec.  1926.1436(g), that a competent  person \ndetermine whether a derrick has passed a load test.      A commenter recommended that Sec.  \n1926.1436(e)(2)(iv) be revised  to add a paragraph requiring derrick users to simulate test/trial lifts  in similar \nworking cycle durations for actual field work cycles. (ID- 0120.1.) The commenter provided no explanation for \nthis suggestion nor  any information on how the practice would improve safety beyond the  requirements \nproposed. OSHA defers to C-DAC's judgment that the load  test procedures specified in paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of \nthis section will  provide the necessary level of safety to employees.      For these reasons, OSHA did not \nmodify the pro posed text of Sec.   1926.1436(e)(2)(iv) to add a paragraph (D). No other comments were  \nreceived on paragraph (e)(2)(iv); it is promulgated as proposed. Paragraph (f) Operational Aids     Paragraph \n(f) of this section specifies the types of operational  aids that must be used on derricks during construction \nactivities.",

The Agency estimates that, for operations near power lines, crane  employers \nwill do so about half the time ($100, or one-half of $200),  on average, for each occurrence.     The Agency \nestimates the average cost for protective measures in  the final standard for cranes to work within 20 feet of \na power line is  about $160. Crane Inspections     The Agency received little comment on its estimates of \ncosts of  inspections. Inspections were frequently mentioned by commenters as  necessary and a lready \nbeing performed. However, the industry consensus  standard requires frequent (daily to monthly) inspections \nand periodic  inspections (monthly to annual ones). The final standard requires daily  visual inspections, and \nmonthly and annual inspections that must be  documented. In addition, the final standard adds more specific \nchecks  on more equipment that the consensus standards. Thus, the Agency is  keeping its estimate that \nmonthly and annual inspections will take 15  minutes longer than is typically done today. Due to an error in \nthe  spreadsheet calculations, in the PEA estimates of the monthly  inspections were too high--based on an \nadditional 30 minutes per month  rather than 15 minutes. When this error was corrected the annual  \nadditional cost for inspections fell from about $21 million per year in  the PEA to $16 million annually. The \nfinal standard has a new provision  requiring written notification when an operational aid is broken or a  \nrepair is necessary (Sec.  1926.1417(j)(1)). The Agency  has estimated  that condition will occur to 30 percent \nof (122,091) cranes annually  and require 0.17 hours (10 minutes) of a crane operator's time (wage  $35.62). \nThis cost of written notification (about $257,000 annually, or  $2 per crane, on average) h as been added to \nthe inspection costs in the  tables. The Agency has also included in the inspection costs the  estimated the \ncost of providing affected employees notice at the  beginning of each shift that a crane function or part is \nbroken (Sec.   1926.1417(j)(2)). The Agency estimates that such notice will take an  average of 3 minutes for, \non average, 20 days by the crane operator. Ground Conditions and Assembly/Disassembly     In the PEA the \nAgency estimated that for each crane job an  assembly/disassembly (A/D) supervisor --likely the crane \noperator in  many instances--would assess ground conditions and power line risks.  Many commenters \nreported that these functions were routinely already  performed, and the Agency has adopted that practice \nas its baseline.  (ID-0341; -0343.) More pointedly, most crane jobs today are performed  by truck-mounted \ncranes. Several commenters noted in both written  comment and oral testimony that these cranes have no \nassembly or  disassembly. While there is a lengthy description in the A/D provision  in the final standard, \nwith pictures, of steps and procedures for  lattice-boom cranes, these cranes perform relatively few crane jobs. \nA  large lattice-boom crane may be assembled for a job lasting several  months--one crane job--while a truck-\nmounted hydraulic crane may  perform three or four jobs in a day. While truck-mounted cranes have  safety \nhazards when extending stabilizers or outriggers, thes e are not  the same hazards associated with lattice -\nboom cranes--or tower cranes  which have their own specific provisions for erection and climbing at  Sec.  \n1926.1435, Tower Cranes. There are also relatively few tower  cranes, which also perform a single \"crane job\" \nthat may last many  months.     No commenter denied that current crane operators assess conditions  \nprior to setting up and operating a crane. In addition to comment in  the record, several organizations provided \ntraining materials that  indicated an assessment of conditions was standard operating procedures  for crane \nwork. (ID-0345.14; -0345.17; -0380.) The Agency eliminated  these assessment costs in the final standard, but \nstill included A/D  costs related to work near power lines.      There was considerable comment about \nground conditions. The final  standard places responsibility for providing sufficient ground  conditions on the \n\"controlling entity.\" Small builders and general  contractors objected to this provision. There were several",

See section V.B \nof this preamble.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  Section 1926.1407 Power Line \nSafety (Up to 350 kV) --Assembly and  Disassembly     The requirements in Sec .  1926.1407 address the \nhazards of  assembling and disassembling equipment near power lines up to 350 kV.  The requirements in \nSec.  1926.1407 are similar in most respects to the  requirements in Sec.  1926.1408, which address \noperations of equipment  near power lines.      One commenter suggested that OSHA amend Sec.  \n1926.1407 to include  cranes used to assist the assembly and disassembly of other cranes.  (ID-0131.) As \nOSHA noted in the preamble to the proposed rule, when an  assist crane is used during the assembly or \ndisassembly of another  crane/derrick, the use of the assist crane, with respect to power line  safety, would \nbe considered \"operations\" and therefore covered by  Sec.  1926.1408 (or, for power lines over 350 kV, Sec.  \n1926.1409).  This is because the assist crane has already been assembled and is  being used for a crane \noperation. Therefore, use of the assist crane  must comply with Sec.  1926.1408 during the \nassembly/disassembly  process rather than with Sec.  1926.1407.      In contrast, a crane that is not yet \nfully assembled is often used  to complete its own assembly. For example, a crane is often used to  load its \nown counterweights. Similarly, it may unload its  counterweights in its own disassembly process. Such \nactivities would be  covered under Sec.  1926.1407 since it is being assembled/disassembled.  Therefore, \nthe provision is promulgated in the final rule without  change. Paragraph (a)     Under this paragraph, \nbefore beginning assembly or disassembly, the  employer must determine if any part of the crane, load or load \nline  (including rigging and lifting accessories) could get, in the direction  or area of assembly, closer than 20 \nfeet to a power line.     As stated in the preamble of the proposed rule, the phrase \"in the  direction or area \nof assembly/disassembly\" was included to address the  fact that, in some cases, the assembly or disassembly \nof a crane takes  place not just in an \"area,\" that is, a fixed portion of the work  site, but also in a \"direction.\" \nFor example, when disassembling a crane,  the disassembly process takes place in an area that includes the \narea under  and around the boom's path as it is lowered to the ground (in most, but not  all cases, the boom \nis lowered to the ground for the disassembly process). Under  this provision, the employer must assess the \nproximity that the boom will be in to the  power line in its path of travel to (a nd on) the ground.      Two \ncommenters expressed confusion about the meaning of the phrase  \"in the direction or area of \nassembly/disassembly.\" (ID -0122; - 0178.1.) C -DAC's intent in including this phrase was to ensure that  \nemployers make the initial 20 -foot clearance assessment based on not  only the area which the crane \nequipment occupies at the beginning of  the assembly/disassembly process, but also with respect to other \nareas  radiating from the initial area, both horizontally and vertically, that  will be occupied as the equipment \ncomponents are added, removed,  raised, and lowered during the assembly/disassembly process. For  \nexample, when assembling a lattice boom crane, the \"area\" involved  will expand as boom sections are \nadded.\\24\\ This area expands in the  \"direction\" in which the boom sections are added. The power line  \nassessment has to be made for the portion of the site that will be  involved as these boom sections are added.",

Benefits     The Agency received \nseveral comments in the record on the benefits  analysis in the Pre liminary Economic Analysis (PEA). For \nexample, the  commercial building supply industry noted that their industry had not  been included in the \neconomic analysis, nor, consequently, included in  the Agency's characterization of risks and benefits. The \nindustry  provided 2008 accident data (5 injuries related to work with cranes) to  the rulemaking record in \ntheir comments. (ID -0184; -0342; -0345.17; - 0384.1.) Stephen Yohay, representing Edison Electric Institute \nnoted  that there was no explanation of the benefit that would result for the  electric utility industry or \nelectric industry employees, and therefore  no evaluation of whether the benefit was reasonably related to \nthe cost  of compliance. (ID -0203; -0335; -0342; -0345; -0372; -0380; -0381; - 0408.) The Agency was also \nmade aware of the potential overlap of costs  and benefits of industries affected by both the construction \ncranes'  standard and the Agency's previously proposed standard Electric Power  Generation, Transmission, \nand Distribution; Electrical Protective  Equipment (subpart V), which essentially resulted in double counting \nof  risk reduction, or benefits, in the electric utility industry as well  as the construction industries working \nfor the electric utility  industry in the cranes proposed standard. This oversight has been  corrected.     \nThe proposed standard's benefits analysis rested upon BLS' Census  of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI) data \nfor total annual fatalities  in the construction industry, an estimate that eight percent of (CFOI)  construction \nfatalities were crane related, and an analysis of a small  sample of fatality reports from OSHA's IMIS data \nindicating that 58  percent of co nstruction crane-related fatalities could be prevented by  the proposed \ncranes standard. The application of the construction crane  standard to general industry sectors and the \nnecessity of disentangling  the affect of subpart V required a different approa ch. The Agency  instead is \nrelying on an analysis of four years of IMIS fatality  reports across all industries to estimate the risk reduction, \nor  benefits, attributed to the final cranes standard. This method has been  used by the Agency to evaluate \nrisk reduction in virtually all of its  safety standards. The Agency collected 506 fatality reports from IMIS  \nacross all industries for the years 2004 -2007. Of these, over 200 were  found to be construction related, \nincluding some in general industry  sectors. One hundred and twenty -six of these (with 132 fatalities) were  \naccidents that the Agency concluded were potentially impacted by the  final standard, and the Agency \nestimates that 88 of these will be  prevented by the final standard, or about 22 per year . The Agency also  \nestimated that the final standard would prevent 175 injuries annually.  The table below describes the industry \nsectors with IMIS accident  fatalities that the Agency concludes are impacted (i.e., potentially  avoided) by \nthe final standard.

(ID -0205.1; -213.1.) The Agency believes  that the foregoing paragraph satisfies that \nagreement. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      C-DAC thoroughly discussed the \nwording of this provision, mindful  of the need for both clarity and sufficient flexibility to enable the  \noperator to ad dress myriad circumstances. The Committee's wording  strikes an appropriate balance. The \nword \"concern\" refers to a good  faith belief that safety may be in jeopardy. The word \"assured\" means  that \nthe qualified person has assessed whatever triggered the crane  operator's belief that there was a concern as \nto safety and either: (1)  Determines that there is not, in fact, a safety hazard, or (2) after  corrective action \nis taken, determines that there is no longer a safety  hazard.     OSHA disagrees with th e commenter's \nsuggestion to link the  authority to a violation of subpart CC. While C-DAC and the Agency have  made every \neffort to address the hazards associated with crane and  derrick operation, there may be circumstances that \npresent hazards that  have not been anticipated here.      In addition, a particular situation may not be \nimmediately  recognized as falling within one of subpart CC's provisions. An  operator's uncertainty in that \nregard could lead him/her to hesitate to  exercise the authority even where it needs to be applied. Also, the  \ndetermination by a qualified person to proceed with operations needs to  be based on whether safety is \nassured, not on the resolution of a  debate about whether the operator's concern fits within a provision o f  \nthis standard.     Another commenter expressed the following concerns: \"qualified  person\" should be \nbetter defined; the qualified person would feel  undue pressure from the controlling entity or crane employer \nto find  that safety had been assured, and that the qualified person's scope of  responsibility once operations \nresume is unclear. (ID -0218.1.)     As explained in the preamble to the proposed rule, the definition  of \n\"qualified person\" in Sec.  1926.1401 corresponds to the  definition of \"qualified\" in Sec.  1926.32(m) and \nreflects the fact  that the duties assigned to \"qualified persons\" here are similar to  those assigned under \nother construction standards. The Committee  intentionally used the same definition to make it clear that \nemployers  could rely on their current understanding of \"qualified person.\" OSHA  sees no reason to deviate \nfrom that definition where the commenter did  not explain how it viewed the definition as vague or provide  \nalternative language.     With respect to the issue of undue pressure on the qualified  person, C-DAC shared \nthe commenter's concern; the Committee identified  pressure placed by some employers on operators to \nproceed with unsafe  lifts as a significant problem in the industry. This led C -DAC, for  example, to include \nthe specific prohibition in Sec.  1926.1417(o)(2)  against requiring an operator to operate the equipment in \nexcess of its  rated capacity (see the discussion of Sec.  1926.1417(o)(2) in 73 FR  59792-59793, Oct. 9, \n2008). The commenter did not suggest, and OSHA is  not aware of, any additional measures that could be \nincluded in the  standard to help prevent the application of that type of pressure.     As to the commenter's \nfinal point, after a crane operator stops and  refuses to proceed with operations due to a concern as to safety, \nthe  qualified person would then assess the situation and determine whether  or when safety has  been \nassured. At that point, the qualified person's  responsibilities under Sec.  1926.1418 would be completed \nunless and  until the crane operator identifies another concern as to safety. The  Agency, therefore, is \npromulgating this provision as proposed . Sections 1926.1419 Through 1926.1422 Signals      Sections \n1926.1419 through 1926.1422 address the circumstances  under which a signal person must be provided, the \ntype of signals to be  used, criteria for how signals are transmitted, and other criteria  associated with the \nuse of signals.     OSHA has decided to replace the term \"lift supervisor\" with the  term \"lift director\" in Sec. \nSec.  1926.1419(c)(2), 1926.1421(a), and  1926.1421(c).",

(See 73 FR 59719 -59723, Oct.  9, 2008.) On the specific question of the need for third -\nparty  verification of a crane operator's qualifications, OSHA has relied  primarily on the opinions of experts \nwith vast experience in crane  operations and the hazards presented by crane use, including the  members \nof C-DAC and construction industry employers who appeared at  the public hearing. OSHA is persuaded that \nthird-party verification  will significantly reduce the number of crane -related injuries and is  confident that \nthe information on which it relies to set this standard  is reliable, the best available, and meets the \nDepartment's guidelines.     A trade association also questioned OSHA's reliance on the Ontario  study, \nsuggesting that Ontario's ability to issue citations to  employees is the likely cause of Ontario's decrease in \nfatal crane  accidents. (ID -0151.1.) OSHA notes, however, that the Construct ion  Safety Association of \nOntario attributed the decrease to increased  operator skill, not employee citations. (ID -0009.) OSHA \ndetermines that  the Construction Safety Association of Ontario was well -positioned to  evaluate why \nOntario was able to achiev e a dramatic reduction in crane - related fatalities and accepts its opinion on the \nquestion. Moreover,  the employee citations permitted under Section 66 of Ontario's  Occupational Health \nand Safety Act did not take effect until 1990.  These employee citat ions appear to function primarily as a \ndeterrent to  non-compliance with Ontario's construction safety standards, as opposed  to the operator \ncertification requirements that are intended to verify  knowledge and skills necessary for safe operation. In \nthat regard, the  civil fine provisions are similar to the licensing requirements (separate  from certification) \nthat Ontario had required prior to 1979. There is no  indication in the record that the fines provided a greater \nlevel of  deterrence than the government's pre-existing authority to sanction an  individual operator through \nthe revocation of an operator's license.     The representative of the building industry claimed that the rate  \nof accidents resulting from crane use in the  residential construction  industry is too low to justify requiring \nhomebuilders to comply with  the qualification/certification requirement in the proposed rule. The  \ncommenter conducted a study, using fatality data from the Bureau of  Labor Statistics, which, according to the \ncommenter, showed that 13 out  of 1385, or slightly less than 1%, of fatalities in the residential  construction \nindustry from 2003-2006 were crane-related. (ID-0232.1.)  Because this percentage is substantially less than \nthe more than 8% of  all construction fatalities that were found to be crane-related in the  Beavers study, the \ncommenter suggests the risk of serious injury from  the smaller truck mounted telescopic boom cranes used \nin residential  construction is substantially les s than the risk of injury from large  lattice boom and tower \ncranes used in commercial/industrial  construction. The commenter stated that a copy of its study was  \nattached to its comment and is available on its Web site. (ID-0232.1.)  In fact, a copy was not attached to its \ncomment. OSHA has located a  document on the commenter's Web site entitled \"Residential  Construction \nFatalities, 2003-2006\" that describes the causes of  fatalities in residential construction, but has found nothing \nin that  document to support the commenter's claim that only 13 of those  fatalities were crane-related.     \nNevertheless, even if the commenter could support its claim of 13  crane-related fatalities, its conclusion that \ncranes present little  risk of serious injury in residential construction does not follow.  First, OSHA determines \nthat 13 crane-related fatalities in homebuilding  in a four year period is significant and well worth trying to \nreduce.  Moreover, the commenter's comparison of percentages is not persuasive.  The fact that a smaller",

OSHA received responses from three commenters, all of whom stated  that this exception \nshould be added to the final rule. (ID-0187.1; - 0205.1; -0213.1.) Accordingly, OSHA has included the exception \nin Sec.   1926.1423(h)(2) of the final rule. Paragraph (i) [Reserved.] Paragraph (j) Anchoring to the Load Line     \nParagraph (j) of this section permits an employer, under prescribed  conditions, to anchor a fall arrest system \nto the hook or other part of  a load line of a crane or derrick.

Therefore, since the hook or other part of a  load line is connected to a hoist in the crane or for the \nderrick,  attaching a personal fall arrest system in this manner had been  prohibited by subpart M.

OSHA concludes that any manufacturer  who specifies wind speed will assume that the wind might be \nblowing in  any direction, including perpendicular to the jib, and take that into  account in the \nrecommendation. OSHA further concludes that  manufacturers (and qualified persons) are well qualifi ed to \ndetermine  the maximum wind speed and finds no basis in the record to set a  maximum wind speed during \nerection of 20 miles per hour. Accordingly,  OSHA is promulgating Sec.  1926.1435(b)(4)(iii) as proposed.      \nParagraph (b)(5) of this section, Plu mb tolerance, requires that  the crane's tower be plumb to the \nmanufacturer's tolerance and verified  by a qualified person. Where the manufacturer does not specify the  \nplumb tolerance, this provision requires that the tower be plumb to a  tolerance of at least 1:500. The tower \nneeds to be plumb within the  manufacturer's tolerance to ensure the crane's stability and prevent it  from \ncollapsing. The Committee noted that a  tolerance of at least 1:500  is generally what manufacturers specify \nand that for any type of  vertical structure this generally is the accepted plumb tolerance in  the engineering \nand construction industries. No comments were received  on this provision; it is promulgated as proposed.      \nParagraph (b)(6), Multiple tower crane jobsites, requires  construction jobsites with more than one fixed jib \n(hammerhead) tower  crane installed to be located so that no crane can contact the  structure of another \ncrane. However, the jibs of multiple hammerhead  tower cranes are permitted to pass over/under one another. \nThis  provision is designed to ensure that multiple tower cranes on a  construction site do not collide with \neach other. No comments were  received on this paragraph. OSHA has replaced the word \"may\" with  \"can\" \nin the final rule to clarify that it must be physically  impossible for the structure of one crane to contact the \nstructure of  another. The text is otherwise unchanged in the final rule.      Paragraph (b)(7), Climbing \nprocedures, contains special  requirements that have to be followed during the climbing process.  Climbing \nis defined in Sec.  1926.1401. Paragraph (b)(7) requires that  prior to, and during, all climbing procedures the \nemployer (i) Comply  with all manufacturer prohibitions; (ii) have a registered professional  engineer verify \nthat the host structure is strong enough to sustain the  forces imposed through the braces, brace anchorages \nand supporting  floors; and (iii) ensure that no pa rt of the climbing procedure takes  place when wind \nexceeds the speed recommended by the manufacturer or,  where the manufacture does not specify the wind \nspeed, the speed  determined by a qualified person. No comments were received on this  paragraph; it is \nunchanged in the final rule. The Agency notes that  several commenters did object generally to the mandatory \ncompliance  with manufacturer requirements. These arguments a re addressed in the  discussion of Sec.  \n1926.1417.     Paragraph (b)(7)(ii) requires the employer to have a registered  professional engineer verify \nthat the host structure is strong enough  to sustain the forces imposed through the braces, brace anchorages \nand  supporting floors. Examples of typical host structures include a  building, parking garage, bridge or pier. \nIf the host structure is not  strong enough, the host structure could collapse and cause the tower  crane to \ncollapse as well. No comments w ere received on this paragraph;  it is unchanged in the final rule.      \nProposed paragraph (b)(7)(iii) required the employer to ensure that  no part of the climbing procedure takes \nplace when wind exceeds the  speed recommended by the manufacturer or by a qualified person if the  \nmanufacturer does not specify this information. The Agency noted that  Sec.  1926.1435(b)(4)(iii) requires \nwind speed to be addressed during  erecting, climbing and dismantling in the same manner as Sec.   \n1926.1435(b)(7)(iii) and requested public comment on whether Sec.   1926.1435(b)(7)(iii) should be omitted \nas redundant. Three commenters  agreed that Sec.  1926.1435(b)(7)(iii) was redundant and should be  \ndeleted.",

The workgroup \ndeveloped recommendations on some issues  and submitted them to the full committee in a draft workgroup \nreport.  (ID-0020.) In December 1999, ACCSH recommended to OSHA that the agency  consider using a \nnegotiated rulemaking process as the mechanism to  update subpart N. (OSHA -ACCSH1999-4-2006-0187-\n0035.)  B. The Cranes and Derricks Negotiated Rulemaking Advisory Committee (C- DAC)      In July 2002, \nOSHA announced plans to use negotiated rulemaking  under the Negotiated Rulemaking Act (NRA), 5 U.S.C. \n561 et seq., to  revise the cranes and derricks standard. The Agency made this decision  in light of the \nstakeholder interest in updating subpart N, the  constructive discussions and work of the ACCSH workgroup, \nACCSH's  recommendation, a positive assessment of the criteria listed in the NRA  (5 U.S.C. 563(a)) for the \nuse of negotiated rulemaking, and the  Department of Labor's policy on negotiated rulemaking (see \"Notice \nof  Policy on Use of Negotiated Ru lemaking Procedures by Agencies of the  Department of Labor,\" 57 FR \n61925, Dec. 29, 1992). The Agency  published a Notice of Intent to Establish a Cranes and Derricks  \nNegotiated Rulemaking Advisory Committee (\"C-DAC\" or \"the  Committee\")) (see 67 FR 46612, Jul. 16, 2002).     \nNegotiated rulemaking is a process by which a proposed rule is  developed by a committee comprised of \nmembers who represent the  interests that will be significantly affected by the rule. Section 562  of the NRA \ndefines \"interest\" as follows:      \"[I]nterest\" means, with respect to an issue or matter,  multiple parties \nwhich have a similar point of view or which are  likely to be affected in a similar manner.   By including \ndifferent viewpoints in the negotiation process, the  members of a negotiated rulemaking committee learn \nthe reasons for  different positions on the issues as well as the practical effect of  various approaches. Each \nmember of the committee participates in  resolving the interests and concerns of other members. Negotiation  \nallows interested parties, including members who represent the  interests of employers subject to the \nprospective rule and the  employees who will benefit from the safer workplaces the rule will  produce, to \nbecome involved at an earlier stage of the rulemaking  process. As a result, the rule that OSHA proposes would \nreceive close  scrutiny by affected parties at the pre -proposal s tage.     The goal of the negotiated \nrulemaking process is to develop a  proposed rule that represents a consensus of all the interests. The NRA  \ndefines consensus as unanimous concurrence among the interests  represented on a negotiated rulemaking \ncommittee unless the committee  itself unanimously agrees to use a different definition of consensus.  As \ndiscussed below, C-DAC agreed by unanimous vote to a different  definition: A consensus would be reached \non an issue when not more than  two non-Federal members dissented on that issue.      In the July 2002 \nFederal Register notice announcing negotiated  rulemaking on cranes and derricks mentioned earlier, the \nAgency listed  key issues that it expected the negotiations to address, and the  interests that OSHA \ntentatively identified as being significantly  affected by the rulemaking. The key interests were:  --Crane and \nderrick manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors. --Companies that repair and maintain cranes and derricks.   \n--Crane and derrick leasing compan ies. --Owners of cranes and derricks.  --Construction companies that use \ncranes and derricks.  --General contractors. --Labor organizations representing construction employees who \noperate  cranes and derricks.  --Labor organizations representing construction employees who work in  \nconjunction with cranes and derricks.  --Owners of electric power distribution lines.  --Civil, structural and \narchitectural engineering firms and engineering  consultants involved with the use of cranes and derricks in  \nconstruction. --Training organizations. --Crane and derrick operator testing organizations. --Insurance and safety \norganizations, and public interest groups.  --Trade associations.  --Government entities involved with",

In this example the criterion in  Sec.  1926.1417(e)(1)(ii) would \nnot be met and the operator cannot  leave the controls.     Paragraph (e)(1)(iii) requires the competent \nperson to determine  that it is safe for the operator to leave the controls and implement  measures necessary \nto restrain the boom hoist and telescoping, load,  swing, and outrigger functions. This provision addresses the \nhazard of  inadvertent movement while the controls are unattended.     Paragraph (e)(1)(iv) requires \nbarricades or caution lines, and  notices to be erected to prevent all employees from entering the fall  zone. \nFurthermore, under this paragraph no employees would be permitted  in the fall zone, including those listed \nin Sec. Sec.  1926.1425(b)(1)  through (3), (d), or (e). This is necessary because the added margin of  safety \nthat results from the operator being at the controls would not  be present in these circumstances.      A \nlabor representative recommended retention of the previous  prohibition of leaving any unattended loads \nsuspended because it  believed that the four conditions for the exemption were unclear and  unenforceable.",

Guy wires are critical elements of \nthe support system for  derricks.     Paragraph (p)(2), Annual, contains two requirements. Para graph  \n(p)(2)(i) requires inspection of the gudgeon pin for cracks, wear, and  distortion. Paragraph (p)(2)(ii) requires \ninspection of the foundation  supports for continued ability to sustain the imposed loads. Since a  derrick is \nmore likely to remain stationary and supported by the same  foundation throughout the duration of its use \nthan the majority of the  equipment covered by this standard, C-DAC determined it was necessary  to require \nthe foundation to be inspected annually in addition to the  items specified in Sec.  1926.1412. No comments \nwere received for this  paragraph; it is promulgated as proposed.  Paragraph (q) Operator Qualification and \nTraining     Paragraph (q) of this section, Qualification and Training, requires  that derrick operators be \ntrained in the safe operation of the specific  type of equipment that operator will be using. Section 1926.1427 \ndoes  not apply.     C-DAC discussed w hether there should be a certification requirement  for derrick \noperators, but decided against recommending such a  provision. The Committee noted that there are no \naccredited testing  criteria to use for testing derrick operators. Nor are there nationally   recognized \naccredited testing facilities readily available. C-DAC  questioned whether testing providers would find it cost-\neffective to  establish accredited testing programs for derrick operators, noting  that most training for \nderricks must be site spe cific because the types  of derricks used, their support structures, and the hazards \nassociated  with specific projects vary from company to company. Moreover, the  accident investigation data \nreviewed by C-DAC did not indicate that  there was a need to require derrick operators to meet certification  \nrequirements similar to those proposed for crane operators.     One commenter opposed excluding derrick \noperators from the  certification requirements of Sec.  1926.1427 of this subpart because  derrick \noperations require similar skills to make a safe pick as those  required for cranes. (ID-0172.1.) Testimony from \nhearing participants  confirmed that the industry was unable to accommodate a need for  accredited testing \nfacilities or applicable testing criteria for derrick  operators. (ID-0343.) A commenter asserted there were no \norganizations that  provided accredited testing for derrick  operators in the industry. (ID -0130.1.)  Overall \nOSHA did not find sufficient evidence in the record to support a  requirement for derrick operators to meet \nthe certification requirements  of Sec.  1926.1427. More general discussion of this topic is provi ded  in Sec.  \n1926.1427.     In reviewing the C -DAC language of Sec. Sec.  1926.1430 and  1926.1436, OSHA realized \nthat the Committee did not specify any  training requirements for derrick operators, which OSHA concludes \nwas  an inadvertent omission.      The Agency noted in the preamble to the proposed rule that it was  \nplanning to add a training requirement to Sec.  1926.1436 and requested  public comment on the addition \nof such a provision.      Commenters supported OSHA's recommended addition, so this sec tion  now \nincludes a requirement that derrick operators be trained on the  specific type of equipment being used. (ID-\n0130.1; -0205.1; -0213.1.)  This provision has been modified from the proposed rule to specifically  address \nthe training that is required for derrick operators.     A commenter asked that employers be allowed to train \nand qualify  their operators and that the qualification be valid for a limit of five  years. (ID-0130.1.) Since this \nfinal rule does not require  qualification for derrick operators beyond that of the training  requirement, OSHA \ndisagrees with this proposition. For additional  information on comments received about training to particular \ntypes of  equipment, see the discussion at Sec.  1926.1427(j)(1)(i).  Section 1926.1437 Floa ting \nCranes/Derricks and Land Cranes/Derricks on  Barges     Section 1926.1437 covers two types of equipment \nin a marine  environment.",

No comments were received on this \nprovision; it is  promulgated as proposed.     Section 1926.1431(p)(2) delineates the alternatives to using \nan  anti two-blocking device during pile driving operations, since the  heavy vibrations of the pile driver \ntypically damage this device. (See  Sec.  1926.1431(d)(45)(v), Anti two -block). The language C -DAC  \ndeveloped for this provision did not distinguish between lattice boom  cranes and telescopic boom cranes. Its \nlanguage w ould have required,  for either type of equipment, that the cable used to hoist personnel be  \nclearly marked so that they equipment operator would have sufficient  time to stop hoisting to prevent two-\nblocking, or to use a spotter to  warn the operator in time to prevent two-blocking. However, in  reviewing \nthe C -DAC language, OSHA realized that marking the cable is  not a sufficient means of preventing two -\nblocking in telescopic boom  cranes when extending the boom because extending the boom while the  load \nhoist remains stationary can cause two -blocking. Instead, a  spotter is always needed to warn against two -",

He further noted that, under the proposed rule, an  operator could \ntake equipment closer to power lines than a qualified  electrical worker. C-DAC concluded, and OSHA agrees, \nthat workers will  be better protected if employers are required to adhere to additional  safety precautions \nwhen it is infeasible to maintain the Table A  clearances. Accordingly, to the extent the commenter \nrecommended that  the standard not permit equipment to come within the Table A distances,  OSHA rejects \nthis commenter's suggestion.      The same commenter objected to allowing equipment operated by  \nnonelectrical workers to approach closer to power lines than a  qualified electrical worker. The rule does not, \nhowever, allow this.  This section requires the employer to determine a minimum clearance  distance that \nwill prevent the equipment from making electrical contact  with the line. Although existing subpart V permits \nemployees to take  equipment closer to power lines than Table V -1 of Sec.  1926.950, the  corresponding \ngeneral industry standard at Sec.  1910.269(p)(4)(i)  prohibits the operation of equipment closer than the \ndistances in Tables  R-6 through R-10 of Sec.  1910.269. In the propo sed revision of subpart V,  the proposed \nrule contains the same prohibition as the general industry standard.  As a general matter, OSHA determines \nthat it is not appropriate or safe for  nonelectrical workers to bring equipment closer to power lines than is  \npermitted under Sec.  1910.269(p)(4)(i) for qualified workers.  Therefore, the Agency does not expect that \ndistances shorter than those  in Tables R-6 through R -10 of Sec.  1910.269 will be adequate \"to  prevent \nelectrical contact\" for purposes of Sec.   1926.1410(c)(1).     Several commenters suggested that when \nequipment operations closer  than the Table A of Sec.  1926.1408 zone are performed, (1) \"qualified  \nemployees\" (as defined under Sec.  1910.269) should be used (ID - 0161.1; -0199.1); (2) the equipment should \nbe considered energized (ID- 0075.0; -0161.1); and/or (3) the power line should be deenergized (ID- 0161.1; -\n0226.0).     Regarding the \"qualified employees\" suggestion, OSHA determines  that the training required \nunder Sec.  1926.1410(m), discussed below,  is more appropriate for construction workers working with \ncranes and  other hoisting equipment than the training required under Sec.   1910.269(a)(2)(ii) for electrical \nworkers. The training required under  paragraph (m) focuses on the actions that employees can take to protect  \nthemselves when working near potentially energized equipment, while the  training under Sec.  \n1910.269(a)(2)(ii) focuses on safe practices for  working on energized lines.      The second suggestion is \nvalid because prudence dictates treating  the equipment as energized when it is closer than the Table A \ndistance  to an energized power line. However, some provisions of the rule  already treat the equipment as \nenergized. These include paragr aph  (d)(8), which requires barricades around the equipment to prevent  \nunauthorized personnel from entering the work area, and paragraph  (d)(9), which prohibits employees from \ntouching the equipment. OSHA  determines that no additional benefit would be g ained by a statement to  \ntreat the equipment as energized and therefore declines to add such a  statement.     The third suggestion \nmisconstrues the standard, which prohibits  work within the Table A clearance distances unless the employer \ncan  show, among other things, that deenergizing and grounding the line is  infeasible. Therefore, except as \nnoted above, Sec.  1926.1410(c) is  promulgated as proposed.  Paragraph (d)      Once a minimum \nclearance distance has been established under Sec.   1926.1410(c), the employer may not proceed without \nfirst having a  planning meeting with either the owner/operator of the power line or  the registered \nprofessional engineer to determine what procedures will  be implemented to prevent electrical contact and \nelectrocution. In  accordance with Sec.",

Sec.  1926.1425(b)(1) and (b)(2). These requirements  were necessary to ensure employee safety, given \nthe additional risks  posed while employees are performing those tasks in the fall zone.     Paragraph (c)(1) \nrequires that the load be rigged to prevent  unintentional displacement, so that workers in the fall zone are \nless  likely to be struck by shifting materials. No comments were received on  this paragraph; it is \npromulgated as proposed.     Paragraph (c)(2) requires the use of hooks with self-closing  latches or their \nequivalent, to prevent accidental failure of the  hooks. However, the use of \"J\" type hooks is permitted for \nsetting  wooden trusses. This exception is designed to enable the truss to be  unhooked without the need \nfor a n employee to go out on the truss. This  avoids the additional exposure to fall hazards that would \notherwise  occur from going out on the truss to release a latched hook.     OSHA received a comment from \nthe building industry requesting that  the exception permitting the use of J -hooks when lifting trusses be  \nextended to lifting wall panels as well; it asserts that the same  additional exposure to fall hazards would be \npresent. (ID-0232.1.)     This commenter nominated a member who served on the negotiated  rulemaking \ncommittee. The member did not dissent during the negotiated  rulemaking to this provision. The commenter \nhas not explained why it  has changed its position on this issue or why its current position  differs from that \nof its nominated member. I n light of this  inconsistency, OSHA has given diminished weight to its \ncomment.\\105\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\105\\ A further basis for \naccording diminished weight to this  comment is that this commenter had a direct channel for presenting  its \ninterests to the committee --its nominee member --and a  presumptive ability to direct its member's \nnegotiating position.  When such an organization submits negative comments to the proposed  rule \nopposing both its own member's negotiating position and the  committee's consensus, it undermines the \nnegotiating process in a  similar manner as when a member contravenes the ground rules. The  integrity of \nthe negotiating process is central to effectuating the  purpose of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990.      \nThe Agency also notes that, in future negotiated rulemakings,  one of the factors that it plans to consider in \nassessing  nominations submitted by organizations is whether the nominee can  demonstrate that he/she \nhas documented authority to bind the  organization to agreements and the position the nominee takes in  \nsuch negotiated rulemaking.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      In addition, \nOSHA notes that there are two important distinctions  between setting roof trusses and setting wall panels. \nFirst, there is  no need for a worker to be exposed to a fall hazard to detach a hook  with a self-closing latch \nfrom a wall panel. Once the wall panel has  been set, a worker can readily reach the hook from a ladder on \nthe  interior side of the panel. Second, wall panels typically often weigh  more than wooden roof trusses; \nthey pose both struck-by and crushed-by  risks to workers if the hook becomes prematurely detached from \nthe  load. Such unintended detachment is more likely to occur with a J -hook  because it lacks a hook gate.      \nOne commenter suggested that the exception for J -hooks should  include requirements for training and \nrigging. (ID-0218.1.) This  commenter acknowledged that the use of J-hooks is prevalent in the  industry, and \nindicated that the specialized training and rigging  requirements it was proposing were intended to protect \nthe component  being lifted. The commenter did not suggest that its proposed  requirements would \nenhance employee safety. Therefore, this paragraph  is promulgated as proposed.      Paragraph (c)(3) \nrequires the use of a qualified rigger \\106\\ in  the rigging of materials in the situations addressed by paragraph \n(c).  Proper rigging reduces the risk for workers who must perform work in  the fall zone. No comments were \nreceived on this provision; it is  promulgated as proposed. -------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------      \\106\\ Section 1926.1401 defines a \"qualified rigger\" as a  rigger who meets the criteria for a",

OSHA solicited public comment on whether the scope \nlanguage should  be modified to explicitly state that forklifts modified to perform  tasks similar to cranes are \ncovered. Two commenters stated that the  inclusion in paragraph (a) of this section of multi-purpose machines  \nwhen configured to hoist and lower by means of a winch or hook would  include forklifts that are modified to \nperform tasks similar to a  crane. (ID -0205.1; -0213.1.) Several other commenters argued that  forklifts \nshould be excluded even if they are configured to perform  tasks similar to cranes and suggested adding \nspecific language to that  effect. (ID-0187.1; -0231.1; -0232.1) These commenters noted that  forklifts are \nregulated under a different section, Sec.  1926.602(c),  and believed t hat Sec.  1926.602(c) was better \nsuited to the hazards  presented by such equipment than this standard. One commenter stated  that the \nchallenges facing modified forklift operators are  fundamentally different from the challenges facing crane \noperators,  thus the standards regulating them should also be fundamentally  different. (ID -0231.1.)     \nThe comments submitted on this issue highlight the need for greater  clarity. This standard ap plies to \nequipment that can hoist, lower and  horizontally move a suspended load. First, as a preliminary matter, the  \nstandard does not apply to forklifts used exclusively in their most  traditional form: placing the forks \nunderneath a load and using the  forks to lift or lower the load. With a \"suspended\" load, the forks  (or \nmodified lifting device) would be above the load.     Second, OSHA has included paragraph (c)(8) to exclude \nforklifts  when used to suspend a load from its forks. OSHA recognized that a  forklift could technically meet \nthe criteria of subpart CC coverage  whenever it is used to suspend a load from its forks (such as by  hanging \nthe load from a chain wrapped around the forks), hoist it  vertically by raising or lowering the forks, and move \nthe load  horizontally by moving the entire forklift. Under such a scenario the  forks are used as the primary \nsupport for a load suspended directly  from the forks, but OSHA concludes that these forklifts warrant an  \nexception from the scope of this subpart CC because they do not utilize  the components in the same manner \nas other equipment covered by this  standard. In contrast, a piece of equipment covered by this standard  \nmanipulates suspended loads by utilizing components such as winches,  booms, jibs, gantries, and trolleys. \nOutriggers and stabilizers are  also often needed to stabilize the equipment while hoisting a load.     Third, \nOSHA is revising paragraph (c)(8) to clarify that the  forklift exclusion applies only to forklifts that do not meet \nthe  definition of multi-purpose machines covered under subpart CC (those  that are configured to hoist and \nlower (by means of a winch or hook)  and horizontally move a suspended load). This standard covers multi - \npurpose machines because they are configured with the above -mentioned  components (winches, booms, \njibs, gantries, trolleys, stabilizers,  etc.), even though they also have a dual function. OSHA recognizes that  a \npowered industrial truck could be modified so that it would qualify  as a multi-purpose machine, such as by \nadding an after -market boom and  hook attachment in addition to the fork attachment. It is the Agency's  \nintent that forklifts that are capable of multiple configurations are  treated as multi-purpose machines and \nexcluded from coverage of subpart  CC only as set forth in Sec.  1926.1400(a). A forklift with a boom  \nattachment affixed to its forks that uses a hook to raise and lower the  load like a crane would be covered by \nsubpart CC. However, as noted in  the preamble to the proposed rule, a forklift would be excluded from  the \ncoverage of subpart CC when its sole means of suspending a load is  a chain wrapped around the fo rks.",

OSHA believes that this limited and conditional \nexclusion will exclude  this equipment when used to perform such deliveries and address the  concerns of \ncommenters who only deliver construction materials to the  ground.     Construction typically consists of a \nprocess of assembling and  attaching (or in some cases, disassembling) a vast variety of materials  to form a \nbuilding or other structure. \\6\\ In building construction,  those materials typically include small, individual \nitems (a few  examples include: nails, lumber, pipes, duct work sections, electrical  items, sheet goods), large \nindividual items (a few examples include:  structural steel or precast concrete columns and beams), and  \nprefabricated structural and building sy stem components (a few examples  include: roof trusses, precast \nconcrete wall sections, and building  machinery such as boilers, pumps, and air handling equipment). All of  \nthese items must be delivered to the jobsite and unloaded from the  vehicle delivering them before they can \nbe used in the building or  structure. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\6\\ \nConstruction also includes the deconstruction or demolition  of a portion, or all, of a structure. ------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------      C-DAC indicated that to facilitate the assembling or \nattaching of  such items, cranes and derricks are often used to hoist and hold,  support, stabilize, maneuver, \nor place them. Sometimes they are used to  place items in a convenient location for subsequent use. For \nexample,  they are often used to place a bundle of steel decking sheets onto the  structure for later \"shaking \nout\" (i.e., after being landed on the  structure, workers \"break\" the bundle and distribute the decking  sheets \nfor subsequent attachment). One of OSHA's construction standards  contains specific requirements related to \nthe landing and placing of  such bundles (see Sec.  1926.754(e)(1)).      Sometimes cranes and derricks are \nused to place an item in a  specific location for immediate attachment. For example, cranes are  typically \nused to precisely place steel columns on concrete footings,  which involves aligning holes at the column's base \nwith anchor rods/ bolts in the footing so that the column can be secured to the footing.  In building and bridge \nconstruction, cranes are often used to precisely  place precast concrete members so that workers can attach \nthem to other  precast members (or sometimes to a structural steel frame).     Cranes are also used to place \nprecast concrete components so that  other items can be connected to them. For example, in utility and sewer  \nconstruction, precast concrete manholes or vaults are placed for proper  alignment with utility pipes; in \nresidential construction, precast  concrete septic systems are placed for proper location in an  excavation. \nClearly, such movement a nd placement of material by cranes  and derricks is integral to the construction \nprocess, and the fact that  this may be done by the vehicle that delivered the material to the site  does not \nmake it a non -construction activity.     Cranes are also commonly used to hoist building materials onto a  \nstructure for subsequent use. Although this is also a construction  activity,\\7\\ OSHA determines that a limited \nexclusion for articulating/ knuckle-boom truck cranes used for such work is appropriate to minimize  having \nthis equipment move in and out of coverage of this rule. ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----      \\7\\ Moving building materials onto a s tructure for subsequent  use is an integral part of the \nconstruction process. This is the  case whether the materials are brought onto the structure by hand,  with \nthe aid of a crane after the materials had been previously  delivered to the ground, or by the same equipment \nthat brought them  to the site. See e.g., January 5, 2001, Letter of Interpretation to  Mr. Jeff Reynolds, \nDivision Safety Manager Pacific Supply, available  at http://www.osha.gov. ---------------------------------------------\n------------------------------      The record shows that articulating/knuckle-boom truck cranes are  often used",

No  comments were received on this provision; it is promulgated as  proposed. Paragraph \n(e)     Paragraph (e) concerns tilt -up and tilt -down operations. In these  operations, one end of a \ncomponent, such as a precast panel, is either  raised, tilting the component up, usually from a horizontal \nposition  (often on the ground) to a vertical position; or lowered, tilting the  component down, usually from \na vertical position to a horizontal  position on the ground or other surface. Note that the requirements in  \nthis paragraph do not apply when receiving a load.     As with any other suspended load, it is dangerous to \nbe directly  beneath the load because of the possibility of a failure or error that  would cause the load to fall \nor be accidentally lowered onto an  employee. To minimize the risk of such accidents, paragraph (e)(1) of  \nthis section provides that no employee must be directly under the load  during a tilt-up or tilt-down operation. \nSection 1926.1401 defines  \"directly under the load\" to mean \"a part or all of an employee is  directly \nbeneath the load.\" No comments concerning this provision were  received; therefore, it is promulgated as \nproposed.     While paragraph (e)(1) prohibits employees directly under the load,  paragraph (e)(2) of this \nsection provides an allowance for employees to  be in the fall zone (but not directly under the load), when \nthose  employees are \"essential to the operation\" during a tilt up or tilt  down operation.     In the \npreamble to the proposed rule, the Agency provided a list of  activities it determined to typically be infeasible \nto do outside the  fall zone and therefore an employee would be in the fall zone for these  activities. The \nAgency requested public comment on whether there were  additional activities that would be infeasible to do \nfrom outside the fall  zone, and whether it would be appropriate to add a definition of \"essential  to the \noperation\" to the standard.      One commenter responded, asserting  that the phrase \"essential to  the \noperation\" does not need to be defined. (ID-0205.1.)     No commenters disagreed with the three scenarios \nlisted in the  preamble to the proposed rule describing instances where an employee is  \"essential to the \noperation\" and must be within the fall zone.  However, one commenter suggested adding to the list the \nactivities of  making initial connections and securing bracing. (ID-0205.1.)     OSHA believes that those two \nadditional tasks--making initial  connections and securing bracing--fall within part of the third  scenario listed \nin the proposed rule preamble (i.e., to \"* * *  initially attach [the load] to another component or structure\").     \nFor clarity, OSHA has decided to modify paragraph (e)(2) by adding  the operations listed in the proposed rule \nand including the  recommendation of the commenter.     One comment suggested that there might be \nsome conflict between the  NOTE in this sec tion, Sec.  1926.1426, and Sec.  1926.1433(b)(4). The  \ndiscussion of that comment may be found in the portion of the preamble  addressing Sec.  1926.1426 of the \nfinal rule. Section 1926.1426 Free Fall and Controlled Load Lowering     This section addresses the hazards \nthat can arise from free fall of  the boom (live boom) during lifts. Live booms are those in which the  rate of \nlowering can be controlled only by a brake; a failure of the  brake will result in a free fall (i.e., unrestricted \nlowering) of the  boom. In contrast, for equipment that has a boom that is not \"live,\"  there is a mechanism \nor device other than the brake which slows the  boom's lowering speed.     The uncontrolled lowering of a \nboom could result in an accident  which could injure or k ill workers in proximity to the load or hoisting  \nequipment. This section prohibits use of live booms in most  circumstances. An exception is provided in limited \nconditions that do  not pose hazards for employees with respect to the use of older  equipment \nmanufactured before October 31, 1984. See discussion in Sec.",

ACTION: Final rule.   \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------  \n SUMMARY: OSHA is revising the Cranes and Derricks Standard and related  sections of the Construction \nStandard to update and specify industry  work practices necessary to protect employees during the use  of \ncranes  and derricks in construction. This final standard also addresses  advances in the designs of cranes \nand derricks, related hazards, and  the qualifications of employees needed to operate them safely. Under  \nthis final rule, employers must determine whether the ground is  sufficient to support the anticipated weight \nof hoisting equipment and  associated loads. The employer is then required to assess hazards  within the \nwork zone that would affect the safe operation of hoisting  equipment, such as those of power lines and \nobjects or personnel that  would be within the work zone or swing radius of the hoisting  equipment. Finally, \nthe employer is required to ensure that the  equipment is in safe operating condition via required inspections \nand  that employees in the work zone are trained to recognize hazards  associated with the use of the \nequipment and any related duties that  they are assigned to perform.   DATES: This final rule will become \neffective November 8, 2010.     The incorporation by reference of specific publications listed in  this final \nrule is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as  of November 8, 2010.

Instead, OSHA \ndetermines (based on C-DAC's recommendation) that a  better approach is to rely on the expert knowledge \nof the marine  engineer, marine architect, licensed s urveyor, or other qualified  person who has expertise \nwith respect to vessels/flotation devices.      OSHA received two comments regarding the use of the term  \n\"quadrennial\" in the proposed rule. (ID -0343; -0344.1.) Both  recommended using the term \"four -year\" \nbecause it is consistent with  current terminology used by the marine industry. In light of this  information \nOSHA revised the term \"quadrennial\" to \"four -year\" in  the final rule in paragraphs (h)(5) and (h)(6) of Sec.  \n1926.1437.     Paragraph (h)(6) sets forth the documentation requirements for the  monthly, annual, and \nfour-year inspections, which follow those in Sec.   1926.1412, Inspections, at Sec. Sec.  1926.1412(e)(3) and  \n1926.1412(f)(7). However, with respect to four-year inspections the  written documentation of the inspection",

The Agency requested public comment on this issue. Two \ncommenters  agreed with the substance of the proposed addition to this provision  (ID-0205.1; -0213.1); a \nthird commenter agreed with the proposed  addition but recommended that OSHA go a step further and  \nrequire a  dedicated spotter at all times (ID -0113). For the reasons explained in  the discussion of Sec.  \n1926.1408(b)(4) below, OSHA has decided not to  accept this latter recommendation for a dedicated spotter \nin all cases.  The Agency has, however, included the additional regulatory text  delineated above in the final \nrule.

For example, if the controlling \nentity is setting up non - crane equipment and discovers during the course of that work that there  is an \nundocumented void in the area where the crane is to be set up,  the controlling entity would be required to \nshare that information with  the crane operator. Although this requirement extends beyond the  \n\"documents\" specified in the proposed rule, it is consistent with the  rationale provided in the proposed rule \nand is supported by those  commenters who favor this provision: C -DAC sought to distinguish  between \ninformation in the possession of the controlling entity, and  information that must be sought out by the \ncontrolling entity. Thus, to  comply with Sec.  1926.1402(c)(2) of the final rule, the controlling  entity has no \nduty to seek out new information not already in its  possession; it is only required to share information already \nin its  possession, whether or not such information is contained in a document.     OSHA received several \ncomments about whether these responsibilities  should rest with the controlling entity as it is defined in Sec.   \n1926.1401 (prime contractor, general contractor, construction manager  or any other legal entity which has \nthe overall responsibility for the  construction of the project--its planning, quality and completion).     One \ncommenter sought clarification on whether a construction  manager/general contractor or a site/project \nowner is  considered the  controlling entity where the latter contracts with the former but  retains \nresponsibility for oversight of certain matters (e.g., quality  control, safety). The commenter also wanted to \nknow if the site/project  owner is still responsible for inspecting ground conditions under Sec.   1926.1402 \nif the construction manager/general contractor is the  controlling entity. (ID-0107.1.) As explained above, the \n\"controlling  entity\" is the entity which has the overall responsibility for the  construction of the project--its \nplanning, quality and completion.  Where this responsibility is split among several entities, there may  not \nbe a controlling entity. In that case, Sec.  1926.1402(d) applies:  whichever employer has authority to make \nor arrange for ground  preparations is required to ensure that the necessary ground  preparations are made. \nIf more than one entity each possesses this  authority, then OSHA holds each of those entities separately liable \nfor  the duty to ensure that the necessary ground preparations are made.     Some commenters suggested \nthat the provision is unclear as to which  hazards, i.e., known or unknown, the controlling entity is required to  \ndisclose. (ID-0166.1; -0214.1.) The purpose of this requirement is to  ensure that the user of the equipment \nand the operator are informed of  hazards that might not be known to them, because they are beneath the  \nset-up area, but are known to the controlling entity. In other words,  under this provision, the controlling entity \nmust examine information  in its possession (such as site drawings, as-built drawings, and soil  analyses) to \nsee if there are hazards beneath the set-up area. If there  are hazards identified in those documents, or if the \ncontrolling entity  has already identified other hazards not in those documents, the  controlling entity must \ninform the user and operator of the hazards. As  explained above and in the proposed rule preamble, new Sec.  \n1926.1402  does not place any new requirements on the controlling entity to  discover hazards that are not \nalready known to it (see 73 FR 59741,  Oct. 9, 2008). The Agency concludes that the provision's language  \nadequately reflects this intent.     One commenter suggested that Sec.  1926.1402 (c) be replaced with a  \nsection that would simply encourage a cooperative meeting between the  controlling entity, the employer \nusing the crane, and the employer best  situated to control and prepare the ground conditions. (ID-0218.1.)  \nOSHA determines tha t such a change would merely replicate the status  quo, an arrangement which the \nCommittee found to be inadequate for  ensuring adequate ground conditions.      Several commenters \nargued that the crane operator, not the  controlling entity, should be required to obtain information about the",

(ID-0232.1, citing Towne Construction, 12  BNA OSHC 2185 (OSHRC 1986) aff'd 847 F.2d \n1187 (6th Cir. 1988).) The  Review Commission and the Sixth Circuit found that the prior rule's  delegation to \nmanufacturers was circumscribed by other regulatory  requirements governing the design and construction \nof cranes. (See,  e.g., 12 BNA OSHC at 2186 noting design specifications in 29 CFR  1910.180(c)(1) applied to \ncranes covered by former Sec.  1926.550.) The  final rule contains design, construction and testing \nrequirements that  are more comprehensive than those applicable under the prior rule.  These limitations \non manufacturers' discretion are sufficient to defeat  a facial delegation challenge. 12 BNA OSHC at 2186, 847",

The Agency notes that despite its name, a \"digger derrick\"  is not a \n\"derrick\" as defined in Sec.  1926.1436(a). Thus, the  additional requirements applicable to derricks in Sec.  \n1926.1436 do  not apply to digger derricks, and the exception from operator  certification requirements in \nSec.  1926.1427(c) for derrick operators  does not apply to operators of digger derricks included within the  \nscope of Sec.  1926 subpart CC.      OSHA also agrees with the majority of commenters who argued that  \nthe exclusion should be  broadened so that it encompasses all digger  derrick work on electric utility poles. \nDigger derricks are  specifically intended to be used for augering holes for utility poles,  placing the poles in \nthe holes (and removing them when necessary), and  handling materials being installed on or removed from \nthe poles.  Excluding all of these uses will minimize the incongruous result of  having digger derricks move in \nand out of coverage while they are being  used for their intended purposes at the same worksites.

In the preamble to the  proposed rule, OSHA stated the Agency's intent to include \na requirement  to provide safe access and egress on tower cranes, similar to the  requirement in final \nparagraph (c)(3) to provide safe access and egress  on other equipment covered by subpart CC, and requested \npublic comment  on the issue (73 FR 59800, Oct. 9, 2008).     Three commenters responded, all stating that \nthe final rule should  include the requirement to provide safe access and egress on tower  cranes. (ID-0182.1; \n-0205.1; -0213.1.) Accordingly, OSHA has added  paragraph (c)(4) to the final rule.     Paragraph (c)(4)(i) of \nthis section requires steps, handholds,  ladders, and guardrails/railings/grabrails on these tower cranes to  \nmeet the criteria of ISO 11660 -1:2008(E) and ISO 11660 -3:2008(E), or  SAE J185 (May 2003), except where \ninfeasible. For the same reasoning  discussed above with respect to Sec.  1926.1423(c)(3)(i), paragraph  \n(c)(4)(i) allows employers to use equipment designed to the  specifications of SAE J185 (May 2003) or, \nalternatively, ISO 11660- 1:2008(E) and ISO 11660-3:2008(E).

Rather, Sec.  1926.1433(e)  is intended to make clear that crane users need not \nindependently  determine whether their equipment meets certain provisions of this  section but may rely \non manufacturer documentation for that purpose. No  comments were received on this paragraph, and it is \npromulgated as  proposed. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\131\\ For \nclarification, the phrase in the final standard:  \"where the equipment has not been modified\" replaces the \nphrase in  the proposed standard: \"where the equipment has not changed.\" -------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------  Section 1926.1434 Equipment modifications      This section addresses the \nprocedures an employer must follow when  equipment is modified in a way that affects its capacity or safe  \noperation. Its purpose is to safeguard against unsafe modifications and  to ensure that the equipment's \ninstructions and specifications are  updated to reflect the modifications so that the equipment may be used  \nsafely.     This section uses the term \"modification/addition\" to refer to  \"modification or addition\" to clarify \nthat an addition to the  equipment is a type of modification and needs to be subject to the same  approval \nprocedures as other types of modifications. For example, the  addition of a generator to the back of the cab \nof a crane needs to be  subject to the approval procedures because it will alter the crane's  backward stability. \nParagraph (a)     Paragraph (a) of this section prohibits modifications or additions  to equipment which \naffect the capacity or safe operation of the  equipment except where any of five options set out in Sec. Sec.   \n1926.1434(a)(1), (2), (3), (4), and (5) are met. Options outlined in  (a)(4) and (a)(5) were not in the proposed \nrule; see discussion below. Option (1)--Manufacturer Review and Approval     Under paragraph (a)(1)(i), the \nemployer must get the manufacturer  of the equipment t o approve the modifications/additions in writing.  \nParagraph (a)(1)(ii) requires that load charts, procedures, instruction  manuals, and instruction \nplates/tags/decals be modified in accordance  with the modification/addition. Under (a)(1)(iii), the original \nsafety  factor of the equipment must not be reduced. Meeting the requirements  of this paragraph ensures \nthat the original safety factor is not  reduced and that all affiliated materials related to safe operation of  the \nequipment (instructions, charts) are updated to reflect the changes  made. Paragraph (a)(1) is promulgated as \nproposed. Option (2)--Manufacturer Refusal To Review Request      Under paragraph (a)(2), the employer \nmust provide a detailed  description of the proposed modification to the manufacturer and ask it  to approve \nthe modification/addition. If the manufacturer declines to  review the technical merits of the proposal or fails, \nwithin 30 days,  to acknowledge the request or i nitiate the review, the employer may  proceed with the \nmodification/addition if it complies with the other  requirements in paragraph (a)(2). In these conditions, the \nemployer may  utilize a registered professional engineer who is a qualified person  with respect to the \nequipment to approve the modification/addition in  lieu of the manufacturer. See Sec.  1926.1401 for the \ndefinition of  qualified person. C-DAC found it important to clarify that this  individual needs to be a qualified \nperson \"with respect to the  equipment involved,\" since specialized knowledge beyond that of a  general \nregistered professional engineer is needed to make the required  assessments regarding the particular \nequipment that is being modified.     The Committee recommended this option because it determined that  \nthe refusal of a manufacturer to review a request, or a manufacturer's  failure to act on the request within a \nreasonable time, would not  preclude an employer from making a modification if adequate precautions  are \nfollowed. The Committee concluded that 30 days would give the  manufacturer a reasonable amount of time \nto decide whether to simply  decline to review the request or to proceed with evaluating it. Also,  the \nCommittee concluded that a failure to respond at all in this period  would fairly reflect an intention not to act \non the request in a timely  manner.     Under paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) OSHA requires that the approval by the",

Section \n1926.1436(g)(1)(i) requires  that the anchorages, including the structure to which the derrick is  attached (if \napplicable), be approved by a qualified person.     A commenter recommended that Sec.  1926.1436(g)(1)(i) \nbe revised to  require design inspection by a registered professional engineer instead of  a qualified person \nas proposed. (ID-0120.1.) However, the commenter submitted  no explanation for the recommendation nor \nany information as to why the use  of a registered professional engineer would result in a higher level of safety  \nthan the use of a qualified person. Since no information supporting this  position was presented, OSHA finds \nno reason to modify the provision  based on this comment; it is promulgated as proposed.      Paragraph \n(g)(1)(ii) requires the qualified person to determine  whether any special testing of the anchorage is needed \nwhen rock or  hairpin anchorages are used. If so, it must be tested accordingly.      The provisions of \nparagraph (g)(1) are similar to what was required  by subpart N through its incorporation of section 6-2.2.1b \nin ANSI  B30.6-1969 and also what is currently in section 6 -2.2.1(b) in its  newest revision, ASME B30.6 -\n2003.\\138\\ These requirements will help the  employer ensure that the de rrick does not collapse due to \ninsufficient  anchoring and injure or kill workers who must use or be in the vicinity  of the derrick. Paragraph \n(g)(1) is adopted without change from the  proposal. --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-      \\138\\ The OSHA standard differs from ASME B30.6-2003 in the  following respect: The ASME section \nstates that rock or hairpin  anchorages \"may require\" special testing. C-DAC believed that it  is necessary to \nexplicitly require that a qualified person determine  whether such testing is needed. --------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------      OSHA received no comments on paragraph (g)(2), Functional test, and  \nit is adopted as proposed. The provision requires that, prior to  initial use, new or reinstalled derricks must be \ntested by a competent  person with no hook load to verify proper operation as outlined in  paragraphs (g)(2)(i) \nthrough (v). The test must include (i) lifting and  lowering the hook(s) through the full range of hook travel; (ii)  \nraising and lowering the boom through the full range of boom travel;  (iii) swinging in each direction through \nthe full range of swing; (iv)  actuating the anti two-block and boom hoist limit devices (if  provided); and (v) \nactuating locking, limiting and indicating devices  (if provided). These provisions are similar to section 6-2.2.1 \nof ASME  B30.6-2003.     OSHA received no comments on paragraph (g)(3), Load test, and it is  adopted \nas proposed. The provision requires that, prior to initial use,  new or reinstalled derricks must be load tested \nby a competent person.  Subpart N required operational tests prior to initi al use of all new  and altered \nderricks through the incorporation of section 6 -2.2.1 of  ANSI B30.6-1969, but a load test was not explicitly \nrequired. C-DAC  recommended that OSHA adopt the revised guidance provided in section 6 - 2.2.2 of ASME \nB30.6-2003, which includes a requirement to load test all  new and reinstalled derricks prior to initial use and \nspecifies the  elements such a test should include. OSHA determines, as did C -DAC,  that compliance with \nthe load test requirements listed in paragraph  (g)(3) will help the employer identify defects in the derrick \nprior to  its actual use. The requirements for the load test are outlined in  paragraphs (g)(3)(i) through \n(g)(3)(iii).",

The purpose  is to expose the fewest possible number of employees to the hazards  presented \nwhen hoisting personnel and to minimize the load on the  platform to the extent possible.      One \ncommenter stated that boom attached personnel platforms should  be limited to a maximum of 4 employees. \n(ID-0178.1.) Because no reason  was provided to support this requirement, OSHA has not changed the  \nrequirement that the maximum number of employees on a platform is  limited to the lesser of the number \nthe platform was designed to hold  or the number required to perform the work. Therefore, paragraph (f)(4)  \nis promulgated as proposed.  Paragraph (g) Attachment and Rigging      Paragraph (g)(1) of this section \nestablishes the requirements for  the device used to connect the personnel platform to the hoist line.      \nThe nature and type of connector used is critical to the overall  safety of the suspended personnel platform. \nUnder this paragraph, a  hook used to connect the hoist line and personnel platform must be the  type that \ncan be closed/locked and must be closed/locked when attached  to the platform. When a shackle is used in \nlieu of a hook, it must be  of the alloy anchor type with either: A bolt, nut and retaining pin in  place; or: The \nscrew type with the screw pin secured against accidental  removal. Any detachable device other than a shackle \nor hook that is  used must be closable and lockable to the same extent a hook or shackle  would be when in \ncompliance with this section. When used to connect the  personnel platform, such a device must be closed \nand locked to ensure  that the platform is secured to the hoist line.     Paragraph (g)(2) requires that each \nbridle leg in a rope bridle be  connected to the master link/shackle in a manner that allows the  platform's \nload to be equally distributed among each bridle leg. The  purpose of this type of attachment is to avoid \nplatform tipping.     Paragraph (g)(3) requires that all hardware used for rigging must  be able to support \nfive times the maximum intended load applied to or  transmitted to that component. Additionally, slings using \nrotation  resistant rope must have a safety factor of ten. These measurements  continue the requirements \nthat were in former Sec.   1926.550(g)(4)(iv)(C).     Paragraph (g)(4) requires the eyes in wire rope slings to \nbe  fabricated with thimbles. The purpose of this requirement is to prevent  excessive wear to the eyes and \npossible failure of the platform's  rigging.     No comments were received on paragraphs (g)(1) through \n(g)(4); they  are promulgated as proposed with minor grammatical clarifications.      Paragraph (g)(5) \nrequires that bridles and rigging used to suspend  the personnel platform be used exclusively for hoisting \npersonnel  operations. Rigging components must be dedicated for the sole use of  personnel hoisting to help \nensure that they are not damaged. Materials  hoisting can lead to damage of the rigging components due to \nmaterial  shifting or excessive loading. This can make the rigging components  susceptible to structural stress \nthat may not be visible, yet  contribute to failure. To clarify that the bridles an d rigging used for  hoisting \npersonnel may only be used if they have not ever been used for  other operations prior to being designated \nfor the purpose of hoisting  personnel, OSHA has modified the regulatory text from the proposed rule  to \nstate that the bridles and rigging \"must not have been used for any  purpose other than hoisting personnel.\" \nParagraph (h) Trial Lift and Inspection      Paragraph (h)(1) of this section requires a trial lift without  \noccupants and with the platform loaded to at least the  anticipated  liftweight. The purpose of the trial lift is \nto confirm that: The lift  set-up works properly; the lift route is free of obstacles; the work  location is \naccessible; no work location will place the crane or  derrick in such a configuration where the intended load \nwould exceed 50  percent of the equipment's rated capacity; the soil or other supporting  surface is stable; \nand that the lift route is suitable for the intended  lift.",

Another commenter stated that it was unnecessary to require a wire  rope inspection each \nshift. (ID-0203.1.) This commenter believed that  per-shift wire rope inspections were an unnecessary burden \nfor  employers with good maintenance programs who have not experienced wire  rope failures. The \ncommenter recommended that OSHA adopt the protocol  in sec. 5-2.4 of ASME B30.5-2004, which allows the \nperiodic inspection  frequency to be determined by a qualified person based on factors that  affect rope life.     \nOSHA rejects this commenter's suggestion which could, at a  qualified person's discretion, result in less \nfrequent wire rope  inspections than were required under former subpart N. Section 5-2.4.1  of ANSI B30.5-\n1968, which was incorporated by reference in subpart N,  provided for wire rope inspections \"once each \nworking day.\" The  current version of B30.5, in sec. 5 -2.4.2(a) of ASME B30.5 -2004,  similarly provides for \ndaily wire rope inspections. The commenter's  reference to the provision in ASME B 30.5-2004 that allows the  \ninspection frequency to be determined by a qualified person refers to  the type of comprehensive inspection \nthat is similar to the annual  inspection required by Sec.  1926.1413(c), not to the shift inspections  required \nunder Sec.  1926.1413(a).      As discussed below, the purpose of this inspection is to ensure  that \ndeficiencies are identified and that, depending on the competent  person's evaluation of those deficiencies, \nappropriate action is taken.  C-DAC wanted to make clear, however, that th e inspection was not to be  so \ncomprehensive and time-consuming that it would be unrealistic to  conduct it for each shift. To clarify that the \ninspection was one that  was reasonable for a shift inspection, the provision states that  neither \"untwisting \n(opening of wire rope)\" nor \"booming down\" is  required during this inspection. OSHA believes that requiring \na  realistic level of inspection each shift will encourage compliance and  ultimately serve to reduce accidents. \nNo comments were received on this  aspect of the proposed rule.      Proposed Sec.  1926.1413(a)(1) \nreferred to wire ropes (running and  standing) that are \"reasonably likely\" to be in use during the shift.  OSHA \nis also removing the word \"reasonably\" to avoid ambiguity.  Accordingly, Sec.  1926.1413(a)(1) is \npromulgated as proposed except  for the minor changes noted above. Paragraph (a)(2) Apparent Deficiencies     \nParagraph (a)(1) of this section requires the competent person to  conduct a \"visual inspection * * * for \napparent deficiencies,  including those listed in paragraph (a)(2).\" Proposed paragraph (a)(2)  established \nthree categories (I, II, and III) of apparent wire rope  deficiencies. The likelihood that a deficiency is hazardous \nincreases  as the number of the category increases from I to III. The basis for  categorizing apparent \ndeficiencies in this way was discussed in detail  in the proposed rule (73 FR 59776 -59777, Oct. 9, 2008). As \ndiscussed  further below, the category determines the options or \"next steps\"  available to or required of the \nemployer under paragraph (a)(4),  Removal from service.     The Agency is providing minor clarifications for \nthe two apparent  deficiencies that relate to damage from electricity. As proposed,  paragraph (a)(2)(i)(C) \nread: \"Electric arc (from a source other than  power lines) or heat damage.\" C-DAC intended that both \"electric  \narc\" and \"heat\" would modify \"damage.\" To make this more clear,  OSHA is adding the word \"damage\" after \n\"electric arc.\" Proposed  paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(B) read: \"Electrical contact with a power  line.\"",

Paragraph (a) Modified Equipment     Paragraph (a) of \nthis section requires an inspection (that includes  functional testing of the equipment) to be performed by a \nqualified  person for equipment that has been modi fied or has additions that  affect the safe operation of \nthe equipment prior to initial use after  that modification/addition.\\71\\ As proposed, this paragraph did not  \ncontain a documentation requirement. An industrial contractor stated  that the standard should require \ndocumentation of this inspection (as  well as the inspections required under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this  \nsection, discussed below) but offered no reasons to support its  suggestion. (ID-0120.) Absent a basis in the \nrecord to add such a  requirement, OSHA declines to require documentation of the inspections  under \nparagraphs (a), (b), and (c).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\71\\ The phrase \n\"modifications or additions\" and the term  \"modifications/additions,\" as used in this section, have the same  \nmeaning (an addition is a type of modification). C-DAC wanted to  emphasize that additions are subject to the \nsame approval procedures  as other types of modifications. Wherever a form of the word  \"modification\" is \nused in this preamble, it is a reference to all  modifications, including additions. --------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------      Proposed Sec.  1926.1412(a)(1)(ii) stated that \"[t]he inspection  shall \ninclude functional testing.\" OSHA requested public comment on  whether it should modify the provision to \nlimit the functional testing  requirement to components that the modification affects or may affect  (73 FR \n59766-59767, Oct. 9, 2008). Several commenters asserted that  functional testing is only necessary to test \nmodifications of the  equipment and other affected components. (ID -0205; -0213.) In contrast,  a local \ngovernment asserted that the functional  testing should be of  the entire crane. (ID -0156.1.)     OSHA is \nconcerned that there may be instances where a modification  has an unanticipated effect on the equipment \nthat would not become  apparent if the test were limited. Therefore, the Agency has d ecided to  require a \nfunctional test of the equipment as a whole. To make this  clear, the words \"of the equipment\" have been \nadded at the end of the  sentence of the provision in the final rule.     During the SBREFA process, a Small \nEntity Representative (SER)  suggested adding an exception to Sec.  1926.1412(a) for  \"transportation \nsystems,\" by which the SER meant any system  dispersing the weight of the crane for movement on a highway. \nAs  recommended by the Panel, OSHA solicited public comment on wheth er to  include such an exception \nand possible language for it (73 FR 59767,  Oct. 9, 2008). No comments were submitted on this point. OSHA \nnotes  that Sec.  1926.1412 specifies the items that must be inspected, and  these items do not include any \nitems dealing with the movement of  equipment on a highway. Paragraph (b) Repaired/Adjusted Equipment     \nParagraph (b) of this section provides that equipment that has had  a repair or adjustment that affects the \nsafe operation of the equipment  must be inspected by a qualified person prior to initial use after the  \nrepair/adjustment. In summary, the qualified person is required to  determine if such repairs and adjustments \nwere performed in accordance  with manufacturer equipment criteria.      Proposed Sec.  \n1926.1412(b)(1)(iii) stated that \"[t]he inspection  shall include functional testing.\" As in the case of proposed \nSec.   1926.1412(a)(1)(ii) discussed above regarding modified equipment, OSHA  requested public comment \non whether the functional testing required for  repaired/adjusted equipment should be limited to testing only \nthose  components that are or may be affected by the repair or adjustment (73  FR 59767, Oct. 9, 2008).      \nSeveral commenters asserted that functional testing is only  necessary to test the repairs or adjustments and \nother affected  components and systems of the equipment.

Sec.   1926.1415(a)(1)(ii)) and 1926.1415(a)(7)(ii)) address the additional  \nhazard that non-operational equipment might remain in the cab, and be  accidently relied on by the operator, \nonce an operational version of  the same device has been placed in the cab.  Section 1926.1416 Operational \nAids     This section sets forth the requirements for equipping cranes and  derricks with certain operational \naids. \"Operational aids\" are  defined in Sec.  1926.1401 as \"devices that assist the operator in the  safe \noperation of the crane by providing information or automatically  taking control of a crane function. These \ninclude, but are not limited  to, the devices listed in Sec.  1926.1416  ('listed operational  aids').\"     As \ndiscussed above regarding Sec.  1926.1415, OSHA determines that  the devices addressed in Sec.  \n1926.1416 enhance safety. However, they  are less essential to the safe operation of equipment than the \nsafety  devices a ddressed by Sec.  1926.1415 because sufficient temporary  alternative measures are \navailable. Crane operators historically used  these temporary alternative measures as safety precautions prior \nto the  widespread availability and use of these operational aids. Paragraph (a)     Proposed paragraph (a) \nof this section provided that the  operational aids listed in this section are required on all equipment  covered \nby subpart CC, unless otherwise specified.     Other sections of this rule provide exceptions for various types \nof  equipment. Under Sec.  1926.1435(e)(1), this section does not apply to  tower cranes. Instead, the \noperational aids required for tower cranes  are specified in Sec.  1926.1435. Under Sec.  1926.1436(f)(1),  \nSec. Sec.  1926.1416(d)(1), ( e)(1), and (e)(4) do not apply to  derricks.     This section also does not apply \nto existing equipment manufactured  before certain dates. Those dates are keyed either to the time an  \noperational aid was first required by a national consensus standard or  to the effective date of the standard. \nOne year after the effective  date of this final rule, the proposed rule would have required all  operational \naids on all equipment, with a single exception: proposed  paragraph (e)(4) did not require load weighing o r \nsimilar devices on  derricks.     A trade association asked that articulating cranes be exempt from  certain \nrequirements of this section: the requirement for a boom angle  or radius indicator in paragraph (e)(1) of this \nsection; the  requirement for a jib angle indicator in paragraph (e)(2) of this  section; the requirement for a \nboom length indicator in paragraph  (e)(3) of this section; and the requirement for an outrigger  position  \nsensor/monitor in paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section. (ID-0206.1.) As  to the first three, the commenter stated \nthat these would not be  practical on articulating cranes because of the boom configuration on  such cranes. \nThe commenter said that a boom angle indicator or jib  angle indicator could not be used because articulating \ncranes can have  up to three boom sections at different angles. Unlike cranes with  straight booms, their \ncapacity is determined by the combination of boom  angles rathe r than a single angle. Similarly, the \ncommenter stated,  boom length indicators are not practical on articulating cranes because  their lifting \ncapacity is based on the position of the boom sections  rather than the boom length. Finally, the commenter \nasserted that  articulating cranes should be exempt from the requirement for outrigger  position sensor \nmonitors because such cranes use stabilizers rather  than outriggers.     OSHA agrees with the commenter \nthat boom angle indicators, jib  angle indicators, and boom length indicators are not appropriate for  \narticulating cranes for the reasons given by the commenter.  Accordingly, OSHA is adding Sec.  1926.416(a)(1), \nwhich excludes  articulating cranes from the requirements in Sec. Sec.   1926.1416(e)(1), (e)(2), and (e)(3).",

Note the  discussion above related to Sec.  1926.1407(b)(2). This provision is  promulgated as \nproposed. Paragraph (b)(3)     Section 1926.1408(b)(3) requires elevated warning lines, barricades  or a line \nof signs, in view of the crane operator, equipped with flags  or similar high-visibility markings, at 20 feet from \nthe power line (if  using Option (2) of Sec.  1926.1408(a) (2)(ii)) or at the minimum  clearance distance under \nTable A (if using Option (3) of Sec.   1926.1408(a)(2)(iii)). The steps required by this provision are  designed \nto remind the operator that there are power lines with  associated minimum clearance distances that must \nbe met. Warning lines,  barricades or a line of signs in the operator's view equipped with  high-visibility \nmarkings also indicate to the operator where the  minimum clearance distance boundary is located. This \nserves as one of  two layers of protection (the second layer consists of an additional  means selected by the \nemployer under Sec.  1926.1408(b)(4), discussed  below).     A commenter urged OSHA to reconsider this \nrequirement because there  is nothing outside of the traveled roadway to which a warning line,  barricade, \nor line of signs could be affixed. (ID -0114.) OSHA  recognizes that this requirement will often require the \nemployer to  install a series of poles or other supports to install an elevated  warning line. However, \ntemporary supports are routinely installed on  construction sites, and installing them for the purpose of \nenabling the  operator to maintain a safe distance from a power line serves an important  safety purpose \nwithout being overly difficult or time -consuming.     A visual line on the ground to mark the minimum \nclearance distance  is not permitted under Sec.  1926.1408(b)(3) because an operator would  generally not \nnotice or see a line on the ground and because, from  where the operator sits, it would be particularly difficult \nfor the  operator to extrapolate from that line the location of the boundary in  the air. By contrast, visual \nreminders that are sufficiently elevated  from the ground level enable the operator to more accurately judge \nthe  distance between the load, load line (including rigging and lifting  accessories) or crane and the \nboundary marked by the elevated warning  line.     In reviewing the C -DAC draft of this provision, OSHA \nrealized that  there may be situations where the employer would not be able to place  such a line so that it \nwould be visible to the operator. In such a  case, to have two layers of protection, it would be necessary to  \nrequire that a dedicated spotter be used in addition to one o f the  other (non-spotter) methods described \nbelow in Sec.  1926.1408(b)(4).  Therefore, in the proposed rule, OSHA stated that it was planning to  \nmodify the proposed provision by adding the following after the last  sentence in Sec.  1926.1408(b)(3):       \nIf the operator is unable to see the elevated warning line, a  dedicated spotter must be used as described in \nSec.   1926.1408(b)(4)(ii) in addition to implementing one of the measures  described in Sec.  \n1926.1408(b)(4)(i), (iii), (iv) and (v).       The Agency requested public comment on this issue. Two \ncommenters  agreed with the substance of the proposed addition to this provision  (ID-0205.1; -0213.1); a \nthird commenter agreed with the proposed  addition but recommended that OSHA go a step further and  \nrequire a  dedicated spotter at all times (ID -0113). For the reasons explained in  the discussion of Sec.  \n1926.1408(b)(4) below, OSHA has decided not to  accept this latter recommendation for a dedicated spotter \nin all cases.  The Agency has, however, included the additional regulatory text  delineated above in the final \nrule.",

Paragraph (a)(2)(i) Option (1)     An employer choosing Option (1) of this section \nwill protect  against electrocution by having the power lines deenergized and visibly  grounded at the \nworksite. This option minimizes the probability that  equipment that contacts the power line will become \nenergized. The power  line must be \"visibly grounded at the worksite.\"      One commenter believed that \nthe requirement for visible grounding  was \" impractical and overly burdensome.\" (ID -0146.1.) A second  \ncommenter believed that this requirement was needed to permit the  employer to visually verify that the \npower line has been deenergized.  (ID-0190.0.)     After reviewing these comments, OSHA continues to \nconclude, as C- DAC did, that visible grounding of the deenergized line is necessary to  protect workers. First, \nit mi nimizes the voltage that can appear on the  power line from a number of causes, including induced \ncurrent and  capacitive coupling, lightning, other energized lines falling onto the  power line (for example, \nwhere there is a traffic accident involving a  motor vehicle striking a utility pole supporting the power line), \nand  accidental reenergizing of the lines. It also facilitates the operation  of circuit protective devices to \ndeenergize the line after it is  reenergized from the last two causes. It also s erves as a visual  confirmation \nthat the power line has been deenergized. (See discussion  of Sec.  1926.1407(a)(1) where OSHA declines to \namend the proposal to  require written confirmation that the power line has been deenergized.)     Where \nthe employer  elects to deenergize the power line, it will not  have to implement any of the \nencroachment/electrocution prevention  measures listed in Sec.  1926.1408(b). However, some amount of \ntime is  needed to arrange for the utility owner/operator to deenergize and  ground the line. Also, in some \ninstances, especially where the  construction project is small, the cost of deenergizing and grounding  may \nbe a substantial portion of the cost of the project. Because of  these factors, deenergizing and grounding, \nwhich was also a permissible  option under former Sec.  1926.550(a)(15), has not been routinely done.  \nAccordingly, the rule provides other safe and practical options to  reduce unsafe practices in the industry. \nThose other options (Options  (2) and (3) in Sec.  1926.1408(a)(2)(ii) and (iii), discussed below)  combined \nwith Sec.  1926.1408(b) are designed to afford effective  protection against the hazard of electrocution.      \nSection 1926.1408(a)(2)(i) is adopted as proposed. Paragraph (a)(2)(ii) Option (2)     Under Option (2) (Sec.  \n1926.1408(a)(2)(ii)), the employer is  required to maintain a minimum clearance distance of 20 feet. To help  \nensure that this distance is not breached and that employees are  protected from electrocution, the employer \nis required to implement the  encroachment/electrocution prevention measures in Sec.  1926.1408(b).      \nEmployers using this option will have to stay further away from the  power line than had been required under \nsubpart N's 10 -foot rule  (employers wanting to use the 10 -foot rule will have to use Option (3)  of this \nsection, discussed below).\\43\\ However, an advantage of this  option to many employers is that they do not \nhave to determine the  voltage of the power line; they only have to determine that the line  voltage is not \nmore than 350 kV.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\43\\ As discussed above, \nthe 10-foot rule requires varyin g  clearance distances increase with voltage with clearance distances  that \nbegin at 10 feet. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      Several commenters verified \nthe Committee's conclusion that  obtaining voltage information from utilities can often be difficult and  time-\nconsuming.

The commenter did not \nexplain  why an aerial lift or manual hoist could not be used.     \\63\\ See discussion of this paragraph below \nunder subpart V - work. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  Paragraph (d)(5)      \nUnder paragraph (d)(5) of this section, if the rigging may be  closer than the Table A of Sec.  1926.1408 \ndistance during the  operation, it must be of the noncondu ctive type. This provides  protection to those \nemployees who would be exposed to electrical  hazards in the event that the rigging contacts a power line, \nwhich  otherwise could energize the rigging and the load.     One commenter stated that he was unaware \nof any sling manufacturers  who market their slings as being nonconductive, and that there are no  test \nstandards for testing the dielectric properties of slings. (ID- 0155.1.) As noted in the discussion of tag lines of \nSec.   1926.1407(b)(2), C-DAC considered the utility of setting specifications  for material required to be \nnonconductive but determined that it would  be impractical, and OSHA has additionally concluded that there \nis no  need to specify test criteria for these materials. The guidance  provided for determining whether a tag \nline is nonconductive applies  equally here. Slings made from nonmetallic fibers w ill meet the  standard \nprovided they are not wet, dirty, or have substances on or in  them that will conduct electricity. Therefore, \nOSHA has concluded that  the requirement that rigging that may be closer than the Table A  distance be \nnonconductive is appropriate, and the provision is  promulgated as proposed. Paragraph (d)(6)     Under \nparagraph (d)(6) of this section, if the crane is equipped  with a device that automatically limits range of \nmovement, it must be  used and set to prevent any part of the crane, load or load line  (including rigging and \nlifting accessories) from breaching the minimum  clearance distance established under Sec.  1926.1410(c). \nThis paragraph  is promulgated as proposed. Paragraph (d)(7)     Under paragraph (d)(7) of this section, if a \ntag line is used it  must be nonconductive. This requirement provides additional protection  to those \nemployees who would be exposed to electrical hazards in the  event that the equipment contacts a power \nline and the tag line they  are holding bec omes energized, or in the event that the tag line itself  makes \ncontact with the power line.     Refer to the discussion of Sec.  1926.1407(b)(2) for further  explanation of \ntag line non -conductivity and public comments received  on this subject. This prov ision is promulgated as \nproposed. Paragraph (d)(8)     Under paragraph (d)(8) of this section, barricades must be used to  form a \nperimeter at least 10 feet away from the equipment to prevent  unauthorized personnel from entering the \nwork area. In areas where  obstacles prevent the barricade from being at least 10 feet away, the  barricade \nis required to be as far from the equipment as feasible. This  provision, along with Sec. Sec.  1926.1410(d)(9) \nand 1926.1410(d)(10),  minimizes the likelihood that any more employees than are absolutely  necessary to \nthe operation will be near the equipment in the event the  equipment, load or load line makes electrical \ncontact with the power  line. No comments were submitted on this provision; therefore, it is  promulgated \nas proposed.  Paragraph (d)(9)      Under paragraph (d)(9) of this section, employees other than the  \noperator are prohibited from touching the load line above the  insulating link/device and equipment. The \nreason C-DAC did not extend  this prohibition to the operator is that the operator, by being in the  cab, is \ngoing to be in electrical contact with both the equipment and  load line. However, this assumes that the \noperator is in fact standing  or sitting on the equipment. There may be some situations where this is  not the \ncase. For example, some equipment may be operated by pendant  control or wireless control; in such cases \nthe operator need not be on  the equipment to control it.",

However, as drafted in the proposed rule, \nemployers using Option (2)  (in both proposed Sec. Sec.  1926.1407(a)(2) and 1926.1408(a)(2)(ii))  would \nonly have to maintain a minimum clearance distance of 50 feet.  OSHA requested public comment on whether \nproposed Option (2) is  insufficiently protective for power lines rated over 1,000 kV . The one  commenter on \nthis issue agreed that the proposed provision was  insufficiently protective for power lines carrying voltages \ngreater  than 1,000 kV. OSHA agrees and has modified Sec.  1926.1409 in the  final rule to conform to the \nrequirement of Table A that the minimum  clearance distance for lines over 1,000 kV be determined by the \nutility  owner/operator or a registered professional engineer who is a qualified  person with respect to \nelectrical power and distribution. OSHA notes  that the minimum distance under Option (2) for voltages \nbetween 351 and  1,000 kV is 50 feet. The Agency expects that the distances set by  utilities and registered \nprofessional engineers in accordance with  Sec.  1926.1409(b) will be at least 50 feet.  Section 1926.1410 \nPower Line Safety (All Voltages) --Crane Operations  Closer Than the Table A Zone      Subpart N did not \npermit work closer than the 10 -foot rule \\55\\  unless the lines were deenergized and visibly grounded or \nwhere  insulating barriers, separate from the equipment, were erected.  However, the Committee \nrecognized that many employers, without meeting  the exceptions, nonetheless worked closer than the 10 -\nfoot rule. The  Committee determined that most employers do not use the option to  deenergize and ground \nbecause of the time, expense and difficulty in  making those arrangements.\\56\\ In addition, the Committee \nconcluded  that an \"insulating barrier\" of the type that is currently available  does not, by itself, adequately \nprotect employees because these  barriers are only effective for \"brush\" contact. If there is more  than brush \ncontact, they will not protect employees from electrocution  because the equipment will damage the device. \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\55\\ As described earlier, the \"10-foot rule\" is \nshorthand for  the formula in former Sec.  1926.550(a)(15) for minimum clearance  distances. Under the \n10-foot rule, for lines rated 50 kV or less,  work was not permitted closer than 10 feet to an energized power  \nline. For lines rated more than 50 kV, a clearance of 10 feet plus  .4 inch for each 1 kV over 50 kV was generally \nrequired.     \\56\\ If power lines are deenergized an d grounded, power is shut  off to the utility \nowner/operator's customers. As a result, utility  owner/operators are understandably reluctant to implement \nsuch  measures. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      To address the insufficient \nprotections provided to employees who  work closer than the 10 -foot rule, the Committee developed, and \nOSHA  proposed, a new approach, which is contained in Sec.  1926.1410. It  consists of prerequisites and \ncriteria that apply when work must be  conducted closer than the minimum clearance distance specified in \nTable  A of Sec.  1926.1408.      In this case, the Committee's rationale misrepresented existing  OSHA \nenforcement policy under subpart N regarding insulating barriers  in two respects. First, current policy \nrecognizes other types of  insulating barriers besides the type to which the Committee  referred.\\57\\ OSHA \nalso recognizes goal -post-type barriers and, in  certain limited circumstances the insulation on insulated \npower lines  operating at 480 volts or less. See, e.g., letters of interpretation  dated February 8, 1994, to Mr. \nIvan Blood (http://www.osha.gov) and  August 9, 2004, to Mr. Mathew McFarland (http://www.osha.gov). \nSecond,  the Agency does accept barriers that protect against brush contact  under limited circumstances. \nSee, e.g., letter of interpretation dated  February 8, 1994, to Mr. Ivan Blood (http://www.osha.gov).",

Adequate ground  conditions are essential for safe equipment operations \nbecause the  equipment's capac ity and stability depend on such conditions being  present. In the \nCommittee's view, there are two key problems regarding  ground conditions: (1) Equipment is commonly \nbrought on site by a  subcontractor, who typically has neither control over ground conditions  nor knowledge \nof hidden hazards, and (2) the entity that usually does  have such authority--the controlling entity--may not \nhave the expertise  to know what changes are needed to make the ground conditions suitable  for equipment",

No comments \nwere received on this provision; it is included in the  final rule without change.  Paragraphs (h) and (j)      \nParagraph (h) of this section requires that only one person at a  time signal the operator. As explained in the \npreamble to the proposed  rule, C-DAC determined this provision was needed to prevent confusion  with \nrespect to which signals the operator is supposed to follow (see  73 FR 59797, Oct. 9, 2008). An exception is \nprovided in Sec.   1926.1419(j) to address situations when somebody becomes aware of a  safety problem \nand gives an emergency stop signal. Under Sec.   1926.1417(y), the operator is required to obey such a signal. \nNo  comments were received on either of these provisions; they are  included in the final rule without \nsubstantive change. OSHA has  modified paragraph (h) to clarify that it is a requirement.  Paragraph (i)",

(See the  discussion of this provision at 73 FR 59746, Oct. 9, 2008.)      No comments were \nreceived on this provision; it is promulgated as  proposed except that OSHA has replaced the adjective \n\"unexpected\"  with \"unintended\" to remain consistent throughout this section. Paragraph (h)(10) Boom Hoist \nBrake Failure     This provision addresses a hazard that can occur both during  assembly and disassembly, \nalthough it is more typically a hazard during  assembly. In many older cranes the boom hoist brake mechanism \nhas an  external or internal mechanical brake band that operates by pressing  against the hoist drum. As the \nconfiguration of the crane changes and,  for example, more boom is added, this type of boom hoist brake may \nslip  unless it has been adjusted to hold the extra weight. The Committee was  concerned that the inability \nof an unadjusted brake to hold the  increased load will not be evident until the additional boom section(s)  \nhas been added and the operator attempts to rely on the brake in a  subsequent phase of the operation. If the \noperator does not first raise  the boom a small amount after the section has been added (with the crew  clear \nof the boom) to test the brake, employees could be injured later  in the process when the operator \nmanipulates the boom and finds that  he/she is unable to brake it.     To address this hazard, the employer \nis required to test the brake  to determine if it can hold the load. In many cases, if it is  insufficient, an \nadjustment to the brake will correct the problem. If  it remains insufficient, the employer is required to use a \nboom hoist  pawl, other locking device, back-up braking device, or another method  of preventing dangerous \nboom movement (such as blocking or using an  assist crane to support the load) from a boom hoist brake \nfailure.     The Agency was concerned that the text of the proposed provision  was not sufficiently clear \nregarding the timing of this brake test, so  it solicited public comment on this issue. OSHA's interpretation was  \nthat the test would need to be done immediately after each section (or  group of sections) is installed, and \nafter all sections are in place  (see 73 FR 59746, Oct. 9, 2008).     One commenter recommended revising \nthe provision to specify that  the brake be tested prior to the commencement of lifting. (ID -0214.1.)  \nHowever, two other commenters wrote that the regulatory text should  remain as is and should no t specify \nwhen to perform the brake test.  They point out that C-DAC's intent in Sec.  1926.1404(h) was to  identify \nhazards and require that they be addressed by the A/D  director. C-DAC designed Sec.  1926.1404(h) so that, \nfor the most part,  the A/D dir ector could determine the procedures (or how to implement  specified \nrequirements) that would be best suited in each situation to  protect against those hazards. They also state \nthat, in some cases, the  specific procedure that OSHA referred to in the proposed rule preamble  could result \nin a greater hazard. (ID -0205.1; 0213.1.)     OSHA agrees that specifying an overly -detailed procedure to \naddress  this hazard would be inappropriate given the myriad of circumstances in  which this issue may arise. \nHowever, the Agency also determined that  the proposed rule's regulatory text did not identify the purpose \nof the  provision with sufficient clarity. Therefore, the final standard does  not specify that the test has to be \nperformed at a certain time that is  tied to the installation of any particular section, but instead  requires a \ntest whenever the A/D director will be relying on the boom  hoist brake to function properly. In short, the test \nneeds to be  performed, prior to reliance being placed on the brake, and the test  needs to accurately \naccount for the loads that will be placed on the  brake.",

Such a  condition could, among other adverse consequences, affect the  operator's ability \nto control the load. Therefore, OSHA has added an  additional provision, in new Sec.  1926.1414(c), that \nrequires the rope  to be compatible with the safe functioning of the equipment.  Paragraph (d) Boom Hoist \nReeving     With the addition of the two new paragraphs, (b) and (c), OSHA is  redesignating proposed \nparagraphs (b) through (f) of this section as  paragraphs (d) through (h) in the final rule.      Proposed \nparagraph (b) would have prohibited the use of fiber cor e  ropes for boom hoist reeving, except for use on \nderricks. In the  Committee's view, the composition of fiber core ropes makes them prone  to degradation \nthat is not completely detectable by normal inspection  techniques. Nothing in the record contradict s that \nconclusion.     One commenter stated that there was no practical reason to allow  the use of fiber core \nropes for boom hoist reeving on derricks but not  in other boom hoist applications. (ID-0121.1.) However, as",

A new paragraph (e)(4)(ii), applicable to articulating cranes, is  added. This new paragraph \nrequires articulating cranes manufactured  more than one year after the effective date of the standard to be  \nequipped with either an automatic overload prevention device, a load  weighing device, a load moment (or \nrated capacity) indictor, or a load  moment (or rated capacity) limiter.

Thus, in  situations where the equipment operator requires the \nassistance of a  signal person to provide signals related to maneu vering the equipment  or the load other \nthan maintaining the required power line clearance  distance, a different person must serve as signal \nperson.\\34\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\34\\ If a dedicated s potter also \nserved as a signal person for  purposes other than maintaining the clearance distance, the  dedicated spotter \nwould be vulnerable to a typical cause of power  line contact--focusing on something else and forgetting about, \nor  being distracted from, maintaining the clearance distance. --------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------      The devices listed in Sec. Sec.  1926.1407(b)(3)(ii) and (iii) are  also defined in Sec.  \n1926.1401. A \"proximity alarm,\" is a device  that warns of proximity to a power line and must be listed, labeled, \nor  accepted by a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory in accordance  with Sec.  1910.7. \\35\\ A \nNationally Recognized Testing Laboratory is an  organization that has been recognized by OSHA pursuant to \nSec.  1910.7  as competent to evaluate equipment for conformance to appropriate test  standards for that \ntype of equipment. Thus, approval of a proximity alarm  by a nationally recognized testing laboratory provides \nassurance that the  device will work as intended. (For a discussion of public comments submitted  relating \nto proximity alarms, see discussion of Sec.  1926.1408(b)(4).)  A \"range control warning device,\" is defined in \nSec.  1926.1401 and is a  device that can be set by an equipment operator to warn that the boom or jib  tip \nis at a plane or multiple planes.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\35\\ The C -\nDAC version of this provision defined proximity alarm  as: \"a device that provides a warning of proximity to a \npower line  that has been approved by a Nationally Recognized Testing  Laboratory.\" OSHA has modified the \nprovision to conform its  language to that used in Sec.  1910.7, the OSHA rule governin g  nationally \nrecognized testing laboratories, and to explicitly refer  to Sec.  1910.7 to make clear that the listing, labeling, \nor  acceptance of a device under this rule must be accord with Sec.   1910.7. ----------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------      OSHA realized that some of the devices listed in Sec.   1926.1407(b)(3) \nwould not be operational or effective against  electrocution during certain phases of the assembly or \ndisassembly  process of certain types of cranes. For example, for lattice boom  cranes, proximity alarm \ndevices may not be able to be used when the  boom is not yet fully assembled; at that point the proximity \nalarm  typically cannot be connected and functioning. Therefore, during  certain phases of \nassembly/disassembly, one of the other options would  need to be used (such as a dedicated spotter) to \nprovide the needed  protection.     However, the proposed regulatory text would have permitted an  \nemployer to select an option under paragraph (b)(3) of thi s section  irrespective of whether it would be \neffective under the circumstances.  To address this concern, OSHA requested public comment on whether to  \nmodify proposed Sec.  1926.1407(b)(3) to preclude the employer from  selecting an option that, in the \nemployer's situation, would be  ineffective, such as by revising the provision to read:      (3) At least one of \nthe additional measures listed in this  paragraph must be in place. The measure selected from this list must  \nbe effective in preventing encroachment. The additional measures  are: * * *.      Two of four commenters \non this issue supported amending the  language of this provision as described abo ve. (ID-0067; -0118.) The  \ntwo commenters who disagreed with requiring that the chosen method be  effective in preventing \nencroachment thought that this provision would  prove problematic for employers; they favored the original \nwording from  the Committee that did not specifically require efficacy. (ID-0205.1; - 0213.1.) These latter two \ncommenters did not present any evidence to  counter OSHA's concern that some of the listed encroachment",

Similarly, an employer \ninstalling wooden roof trusses would  be a \"user of equipment\" if that employer directs a crane to place  the \ntrusses on the structure. A general contractor handling several  subcontracting areas, but not the controlling \nentity for the worksite,  would also be a \"user of equipment\" if it directs its subcontractors  to use a crane to \nhoist materials. In the latter example, the general  contractor and the subcontractor would each be a \"user of \nequipment.\" Paragraph (d)     In the event that no controlling entity exists, Sec.  1926.1402(d)  provides \nthat the requirement in Sec.  1926.1402(c)(1) must be met by  the employer that has authority at the site to \nmake or arrange for  ground preparations needed to meet the requirements of Sec.   1926.1402(b). For \nexample, if the employer who hires the crane has the  authority to get the ground prepared in the absence of \na controlling  entity, the responsibility for complying with Sec.  1926.1402(b) would  fall to that employer . \nHowever, that employer would not be required to  comply with Sec.  1926.1402(c)(2) because the \ninformation required to  be disclosed under Sec.  1926.1402(c)(2) is not likely to be available  to that \nemployer.     One commenter suggested that paragraph (d) of this section be  revised to read that the \nrequirements in Sec.  1926.1402(c)(1) must be  met by a competent person designated by the employer that \nhas authority  at the site to make or arrange for ground preparations needed to meet  the requirements of \nSec.  1926.1402(b). (ID-0191.1.) As explained above  with respect to a similar suggestion regarding Sec.  \n1926.1402(c), OSHA  determines this would have the effect of unduly fragmenting the  responsibility for \nground conditions, which is contrary to the intent  of the provisi on.     For the reasons above, OSHA is \npromulgating Sec.  1926.1402(d) as  proposed. Paragraph (e)      Proposed Sec.  1926.1402(e) \nestablished a mechanism for a  controlling entity to obtain information from the A/D director or the  \nequipment operator abou t insufficient ground conditions and the  preparations needed to correct the \nproblem. Specifically (as discussed  above in the context of Sec.  1926.1402(c)(1)), if the A/D director or  \nequipment operator determines that ground conditions do not meet the  criteria in Sec.  1926.1402(b), that \nperson's employer is required to  have a discussion with the controlling entity regarding the ground  \npreparations needed so that, with the use of suitable supporting  materials/devices (if necessary), the \nrequirements in Sec.   1926.1402(b) can be met.      The Committee determined that, in some instances, \nthe controlling  entity may lack the expertise needed to know what ground preparations  may be needed. In \nsuch cases, it is necessary for the information it  needs to be provided by the A/D director or operator, who \nhas that  expertise, so that the preparations needed for safe crane operations  can be made. The Committee \nconcluded that, in such circumstances, such  a discussion would make it more likely that the requirements in \nSec.   1926.1402(b) would be met, which, as discussed above, is necessary for  safe crane operations.      \nOne commenter suggested that the provision will encourage disputes.  The commenter suggested that rental \ncompanies would not accept a  controlling entity's ground conditions unless the controlling entity  purchases \nservices from the rental company to improve them. (ID- 0105.1.)     OSHA determines that the commenter's \nconcerns are unwarranted.  Section 1926.1402(e) is a mechanism for a controlling entity to obtain  \ninformation to facilitate its compliance with Sec.  1926.1402(c)(1).

Paragraph (d) Anchoring and Guying     Paragraph (d) of \nthis section lists requirements for anchoring and  guying derricks to the surfaces that support them.      \nParagraph (d)(1) requires the use of load anchoring data developed  by the manufacturer or a qualified person. \nSubpart N, via sec. 6 -1.4.3  of ANSI B30.6 -1969, required load anchoring data for non -permanent  \ninstallations, which include most derricks used for construction work,  to be determined by the user. The 2003 \nversion of ASME B30.6 requires  the data to be determined by a qualified person. C-DAC concluded that,  to \nbetter ensure safety, a qualified person (as defined in Sec.   1926.1401) is needed to develop such data. The \nfinal rule affords the  employer the additional flexibility of relying on data provided by the  derrick \nmanufacturer rather than relying exclusively on a qualified  person to develop such data.\\137\\ No comments \nwere received for this  provision; it is promulgated as proposed. -----------------------------------------------------------\n----------------      \\137\\ C-DAC believed that derrick users should be able to rely  on data developed by the \nmanufacturer or a qualified person for any  type of installation and therefore did not distinguish between fixed  \nand temporary installations for this purpose.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \nParagraph (d)(2) of this section,  Guy derricks, lists additional  requirements, for anchoring and guying, that \nare specific to the use of  guy derricks. These provisions are similar to sec. 6-1.4.1 of ANSI  B30.6-1969 and \nASME B30.6-2003. Under paragraph (d)(2)(i) the mast  based must be anchored. Paragraph (d)(2)(ii) provides \nthat the guys  must be secured to the ground or another firm anchorage. And under  paragraph (d)(2)(iii) the \nanchorage and guying must be designed to  withstand maximum horizontal and vertical forces encountered \nwhen  operating within rated capacity with the particular guy slope and  spacing specified for the application. \nNo comments were received for  paragraph (d)(2); it is promulgated as proposed.      Paragraph (d)(3) of \nthis section, Stiffleg derricks, lists  anchoring and guying requirements that are specific to the use of  stiffleg \nderricks. This paragraph is similar to sec. 6 -1.4.2 in ANSI  B30.6-1969 and ASME B30.6 -2003.     Under \nparagraph (d)(3)(i) the mast base and stifflegs must be  anchored. Additionally, (d)(3)(ii) provides that the mast \nbase and  stifflegs must be designed to withstand maximum horizontal and vertical  forces encountered \nwhen operating within rated c apacity with the  particular stiffleg spacing and slope specified for the \napplication.  Paragraph (d)(3) had no comments and is promulgated as proposed. Paragraph (e) Swingers and \nHoists     Paragraph (e) of this section lists requirements for swinger  mechanisms and hoists that are used \nas part of a derrick. Paragraph  (e)(1) requires that the boom, swinger mechanisms, and hoists be  suitable \nfor the derrick work intended and be anchored to prevent  displacement from the imposed loads. This \nprovision is similar to sec.  6-1.5.1 of ANSI B30.6 -1969 and sec. 6 -1.5 of ASME B30.6 -2003. No  comments \nwere received for paragraph (e)(1); it is promulgated as  proposed.     Paragraph (e)(2) of this section, \nHoists, specifies the minimum  requirements for hoists used for derricks. This paragraph of the  proposed \nrule was originally titled and related to base-mounted drum  hoists. However, a tank building institute whose \nmembers use derricks  routinely commented that confusion will result in their industry from  the use of the \nterm \"Base -Mounted Drum Hoists,\" in this context. (ID - 0130.1.) Hoists used are not limited to the base -\nmounted type. The  commenter requested that the regulatory text of Sec.",

Voice signals will not serve their  intended purpose if they \ncannot be understood, or can be  misinterpreted. The inability of these worker s to understand each other  \ncould lead to accidents that occur when, for example, the crane  operator moves a load in a different direction \nthan the signal person  intends.     One commenter suggested that uniform verbal signals were necessary  \nto limit th e likelihood of miscommunications resulting from language  barriers. (ID -0379.1.) Three \ncommenters suggested that OSHA establish  uniform verbal signals enhanced by diagrams and pictures. (ID-\n0110.1; - 0115.1; -0178.1.) Two of these commenters suggested that OSHA require  these verbal signal charts \nto be conspicuously posted in the vicinity  of the hoisting operations. (ID-0110.1; -0115.1.)     As discussed \nabove, C-DAC considered whether the rule should  include a standardized set of voice signals and decided that \nit would  not be practical to do so. It did, however, address the potential for  miscommunication by \ndeveloping the requirements in Sec.  1926.1421(a)  (requiring a meeting between the operator, signal person \nand lift  director to determine which verbal signals will be used). Having  received no evidence to the contrary, \nOSHA has decided to defer to the  expertise of the Committee, and is promulgating this requirement  without \nsubstantive change. The word \"shall\" is replaced with  \"must\" in paragraphs (b) and (c) to remove any doubt \nthat the  sentences are imperative commands, rather than descriptive.  Section 1926.1422 Signal s--Hand \nSignal Chart     Section 1926.1422 requires that hand signal charts be posted on the  equipment or readily \navailable at the site. OSHA is requiring the  charts to be posted to serve as a reference for operators and signal  \npersons of the mandatory hand signals and thereby help avoid  miscommunication.     Three commenters \nsuggested that Sec.  1926.1422 be rewritten to  require that the hand signal charts be \"conspicuously posted \nin the  vicinity of\" the hoisting operations, rather than merely making them  \"readily available at the site\" as \nproposed. (ID-0110.1; -0115.1; - 0178.1.)     Upon further reflection, the Agency acknowledges that the \noriginal  language (that the hand signal chart could be \"readily available at  the site\") did not afford the same \namount of protection afforded by  \"conspicuously posted in the vicinity of the hoisting operations.\"  For \nexample, a hand signal chart stored in a shop trailer on the other  side of the site or obscured from sight by \nother objects might be  \"readily available at the site,\" but it would do little to ensure  that the chart would \nbe accessed by employees where it is needed. It is  the Agency's intent that employees be able to access the \nchart quickly.  OSHA therefore decided to modify the language of Sec.  1926.1422 to  require that signal \ncharts be conspicuously posted in the vicinity of  hoisting operations, or on the equipment. Section 1926.1423 \nFall Protection     This section contains provisions designed to protect workers on  equipment covered by \nthis subpart from fall hazards. (See Sec.   1926.1431, Hoisting Personnel, for fall protection provisions that  \napply when equipment is used to hoist personnel).      Falls have tradi tionally been the leading cause of \ndeaths among  construction workers. BLS data for 2004 and 2005, the latest years for  which complete \nfigures are available, shows 445 fatalities from falls  in 2004 (ID-0023) and 394 in 2005 (ID-0024). In 2004, 20 \nfatalities  resulted from falls from nonmoving vehicles and in 2005, such falls  caused 18 deaths. A recent \nstudy of crane -related fatalities in the  U.S. construction industry found that 2% resulted from falls. J.E.  \nBeavers, J.R. Moore, R. Rinehart, and W.R.

(ID -0053.1.)     Section 5-1.3.1 of ASME \nB30.5-2004 has a paragraph (b), which  contains its own text, as well as two subsidiary paragraphs, \nenumerated  (1) and (2), each of which also contains text. The ASME prohibition  against live booms is in the \ntext of paragraph (b) of ASME B30.5 -2004  sec. 5-1.3.1. Free fall is not mentioned in subsidiary paragraphs  \n(b)(1) or (b)(2) of ASME B30.5 -2004 sec. 5 -1.3.1.     Section 1926.1433 incorporates the concepts in only \nsubsidiary  paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of ASME B30.5-2004 sec. 5-1.3.1; it does  not incorporate the portions \nof paragraph (b) of ASME B30.5 -2004 sec.  5-1.3.1 that would conflict with Sec.  1926.1433. There is, \ntherefore,  no conflict between Sec. Sec.  1926.1426(a) and 1926.1433(b)(4).      Paragraph Sec.  \n1926.1426(a)(2) is promulgated as proposed. Paragraph (b) Preventing Boom Free Fall     Paragraph (b) of \nthis section establishes criteria for the boom  hoist on equipment with a boom designed to free fall. \nParagraphs (b)(1)  through (b)(4) specify the mechanisms or devices that a boom hoist can  utilize as a \nsecondary means to prevent boom free fall wh en the primary  system fails. C-DAC determined that each of \nthese were effective means  of preventing boom free fall, and OSHA agrees. The addition of a listed  \nsecondary mechanism or device to prevent the fall of the boom changes  the characteristics of e quipment \ndesigned with a live boom, decreasing  the risk of injury to employees. Therefore, if equipment has a boom  \nhoist with a secondary mechanism or device listed in paragraphs (b)(1)  through (4), it is not considered a live \nboom for purposes of the  limitations of (a) of this section. No comments were received on these  provisions; \nthey are promulgated as proposed. Paragraph (c) Preventing Uncontrolled Retraction     Paragraph (c) of this \nsection requires hydraulic telescoping booms  (which are also r eferred to as hydraulic extensible booms) to \nhave an  integrally mounted holding device to prevent the boom from retracting  in the event of hydraulic \nfailure.     The C-DAC draft of this provision stated that the purpose of this  device was \"to prevent boom \nmovement in the event of hydraulic  failure.\" OSHA determines that this language was unintentionally broad  \nin that it refers to any \"boom movement.\" In the proposed rule, OSHA  modified the language to state that \nthe purpose of the integrally  mounted holding device is \"to prevent the boom from retracting\" in  the event \nof hydraulic failure and requested public comment on this  change.     Two commenters agreed with the \nmodification and no commenters  disagreed. (ID -0205.1; -0213.1.) The text of Sec.  1926.1426(c) is  \ntherefore promulgated as proposed. Paragraph (d) Load Line Free Fall      Paragraph (d) of this section lists \nthe circumstances under which  free fall of the load line hoist is prohibited, and controlled load  lowering \nmust be used. \"Free fall (of the load line)\" is defined in  Sec.  1926.1401 to mean \"where only the brake is \nused to regulate the  descent of the load line (the drive mechanism is not used to drive the  load down faster \nor retard its lowering).\" \"Free fall\" is contrasted  with \"controlled load lowering,\" which Sec.  1926.1401 \ndefines as  \"lowering a load by means of a mechanical hoist drum device that  allows a hoisted load to be \nlowered with maximum control using the gear  train or hydraulic components of the hoist mechanism.",

OSHA agrees with the commenters that manufacturer's equipment - specific inspection \nrequirements can help promote safety. For this  reason, Sec.  1926.1412(j) provides that any  additional \ninspection  requirements recommended by the manufacturer must be followed by  employers. However, \nOSHA does not agree with the commenters regarding  their assessment that the minimum inspection \nrequirements and schedules  specified in Sec.  192 6.1412 are more burdensome for employers who use  \narticulating lifting equipment in particular. There is no evidence in  the record that inspections recommended \nby manufacturers are as  thorough as those provided in this section. To the extent that they  are, there is no \nadditional burden to employers in requiring them to  follow this section than to follow the manufacturer's \nrecommendations. Paragraph (k)     OSHA determines that the competent person or persons who conduct  \nshift and monthly inspections, and the qualified person who conducts  annual inspections, must have access \nto all written documents produced  under this section, during the time for which the employer is required  \nto retain those documents, so that they are made aware of any  components of the equipment that may \nrequire special attention during  their inspections. Accordingly, OSHA is adding a new paragraph (k) at  the \nend of Sec.  1926.1412.  Section 1926.1413 Wire Rope--Inspection     Cranes and derricks use wire rope to \nlift and support their loads  and parts of the equipment. If the rope is worn or damaged, it can  break, causing \nthe equipment to fail and/or the load to fall, which can  kill or injure workers. Approximately 3% of crane \nfatalities in  construction work result from wire ropes snapping. J.E. Beavers et al,  Crane-Related Fatalities in \nthe Construction Industry, 132 Journal of  Construction Engineering and Management 901, 903 (Sept. 2006). \n(ID- 0011.) Accordingly, C -DAC concluded it would improve crane/derrick  safety to establish updated \nrequirements for wire rope inspections.     The definition C-DAC developed for proposed Sec.  1926.1401 \ndefined  \"wire rope\" as \"rope made o f wire.\" In the preamble of the proposed  rule, OSHA noted that this \ndefinition could be read to exclude rope  made with a fiber core, which, as discussed below under Sec.   \n1926.1414, may be used for purposes other than boom hoist reeving. OSHA  requested public comment on \nwhether a more appropriate definition would  be the following one used by the Specialized Carriers & Rigging  \nAssociation:      A flexible rope constructed by laying steel wires into various  patterns of multi -wired \nstrands around a core  system to produce a  helically wound rope.   (73 FR 59739, Oct. 9, 2008.) Three \ncommenters supported this revised  definition, and none were opposed. (ID -0187.1; -0205.1; -0213.1.)  \nAccordingly, OSHA is revising the definition in Sec.  1926.1401 to that  quoted above.      One of the \ncommenters supporting the revised definition also stated  that OSHA should not exclude wire rope with a \nsynthetic or fiber core  and should include definitions of these terms. (ID -0187.1.) However, as  OSHA \nexplained in the proposed rule, the revised definition is designed  to encompass cores other than wire, and \nOSHA determines it is not  necessary to include separate definitions for each type of such rope to  make clear \nthat they fall within the definition of \"wire rope.\"      The proposed rule provided for wire rope inspections \nat the same  frequency--shift, monthly, and annually--that would apply for other  crane components under \nSec.  1926.1412. It also proposed that, like  inspections of other components, the shift and monthly \ninspections be  conducted by a \"competent person,\" and the annual inspection by a  \"qualified person.\" As \ndiscussed below, OSHA is retaining this  equivalence of frequency and qualifications in the final rule. Paragraph \n(a) Shift Inspection     Paragraph (a)(1) of this section of the proposed rule required a  shift inspection by a \ncompetent person.",

He stressed the importance of having  qualified riggers, stating that \nin his experience most of the accidents  he has seen and been involved with or investigated have involved  \nproblems with rigging. (ID -0343.)     After considering the record, OSHA is including the qualified  rigger \nrequirement in the final rule and it applies to all rigging used  for assembly/disassembly.  Section 1926.1405 \nDisassembly--Additional Requirements for Disassembly  of Booms and Jibs (Applies to Both the Use of \nManufacturer Procedures  and Employer Procedures)     Section 1926.1405 requires that none of the pins \nin the pendants be  removed (partly or completely) when the pendants are in tension. In  addition, none of \nthe pins (top or bottom) on boom sections located  between the pendant attachment points and the \ncrane/derrick body are to  be removed, partly or completely, when the pendants are in tension.  None of the \npins (top or bottom) on boom sections located between the  uppermost boom section and the crane/derrick \nbody are to be removed,  partly or completely, when the boom is being supported by the uppermost  boom \nsection resting on the ground (or other support). Finally, none of  the top pins on boom sections located on \nthe cantilevered portion of  the boom being removed (the portion being removed ahead of the pendant  \nattachment points) are to be removed (partly or completely) until the  cantilevered section to be removed is \nfully supported. (See the  discussion of these requirements at 73 FR 59748, Oct. 9, 2008.)     The Committee \ndetermined that many of the accidents associated with  cranes occur during the removal of pendant, bo om \nand jib pins. The  Committee determined that accidents typically occur because of a  failure to recognize that, \nin certain situations, particular pins are  \"in tension.\" If partly or fully removed while in that state the  result \ncan be unplanned movement of a component or the collapse of the  boom or jib.      Consequently, the \nCommittee concluded that the removal of pendant,  boom section and jib pins warrants heightened attention. \nThis section  focuses on protecting employees from these hazards during the  dismantling of booms and jibs, \neither when disassembling the crane/  derrick or when changing the length of a boom or jib. To make clear  \nthat \"dismantling\" includes activities such as shortening a boom,  final Sec.  1926. 1401 defines \"dismantling\" \nto include \"partial  dismantling (such as dismantling to shorten a boom or substitute a  different \ncomponent).\"     In this section, the Committee identified particular scenarios  that, in the experience of \nmany of the Committee members, pose specific  hazards in disassembly if the wrong pins (that is, pins that \nare in  tension) are partly or completely removed. The Committee concluded that  the failure to follow the \nprovisions would very likely result in  unintended movement and/or collapse of the components. OSHA agrees \nthat  these requirements will help to prevent unintended movement or collapse  of booms or jibs as they are \nbeing disassembled.     Several comments were received regarding the illustrations in this  section of the \nproposed rule. Two commenters noted the illustration of  a tower crane in figure 2 of the proposed rule and \nsuggested it be  replaced with a mobile crane. (ID -0205.1;-0213.1.) Two commenters  recommended that \nfigures 4 and 6 be changed such that no pins would be  permitted to be removed without blocking the entire \nboom. (ID-0131.1; - 0292.) Specifically, these commenters did not believe that the bottom  boom connecting \npins could be removed due to the weight of the  cantilevered boom exerting force on these bottom connecting \npins. They  stated that if there was sufficient clearance between the connecting  lugs to enable the pins to \nbe removed, the boom could move downward  upon the removal of the pins.",

Work that \nis  construction work and covered by the final standard, and not subpart V,  is not an every day occurrence \nfor the two industry sectors. Indeed,  the Agency believes that this estimate is likely higher than the most  \nefficient solution that these two industries will devise, but, for  purposes of showing that the final standard is \neconomically feasible  even with this many journeymen certified as crane operators, the Agency  believes it \nis sufficient. Accordingly, the Agency estimates that NAICS   221110 Electric Power Generation will expend \nresources to certify about  10,000 journeymen as crane operators, and NAICS 221120 Electric Power  \nTransmission, Control, and Distribution about 20,000.      Two natural gas sectors are potentially affected by \nthe  final standard: NAICS 221210 Natural Gas Distribution and 486210  Pipeline Transportation of Natural \nGas. Both industries were reported  to be impacted by the final standard. (ID-0155.1; -0328.1; -0344.)  NAICS \n237120 Oil and Gas Pipeline Construction performs much of the  construction of new gas pipelines, the Agency \nconcludes. However, the  two natural gas sectors likely also perform some pipeline work  themselves--or at \nleast some employers in the industries do. Sideboom  cranes are commonly used in pipeline construction, but \nare exempt from  the requirement for crane operator certification. The Agency concludes  that the major \nsignificant cost for these industries is certifying  operators for their other, mostly truck-mounted cranes. Power \nline  safety issues occur most often below ground, and the Agency concludes  that the industry already \naddresses these issues, based on comments  (ID-0155.1; -0344). The 2006 CPB and SUSB shows that Natural \nGas  Distribution sector has 2,458 establishments and 78,813 employees;  while Pipeline Transportation of \nNatural Gas has 1,363 establishments  with 22,248 employees. According to BLS' 2008 Occupational \nEmployment  survey, Natural Gas Distribution has 2,390 employees who are electric  line installers, 950 who \nare operating engineers and other construction  equipment operators, 1,180 heavy truck drivers and tractor \ntrailer  drivers, and no crane operators. For the Pipeline Transportation of  Natural Gas, the employment \nfigures are 50, 130, zero, and also no  crane operators, respectively, for the same employment categories. The  \nAgency concludes that the Natural Gas Distribution industry is  performing significant pipeline work, mainly \nwith excavation equipment,  and each company on average has over 30 employees. The Agency concludes  \nthat the average employer in this industry may be using one crane that  is not a sideboom crane and needs to \ncertify the operator for new  construction work that would be covered by the standard. The Agency  also \nconcludes that the Pipeline Transportation of Natural Gas has  considerably less construction activity that \nwould involve cranes  covered by the final standard and that the average establishment or  employer only \nhas about 10 employees. The Agency estimates that as few  as 50 employers in this industry sector are using \nequipment in  construction activity that would necessitate certifying crane  operators.      The Structural \nBuilding Components Association (SBCA)  commented in the record that many of their members use \"boom \ncrane  trucks to deliver and/or set their products at the jobsite.\" (ID - 0218.1.) Their members m anufacture \n\"roof and floor trusses, wall  panels, I-joists, engineered wood beams, plywood and oriented strand  board \n* * *. In most instances the components are simply unloaded at  the jobsite, using either a custom roll -off \ntrailer, a forklift, or a  boom truck crane, and left for the builder to install. It is not  uncommon for a \ncomponent manufacturer who utilizes a boom truck to  deliver both in markets that require hoisting and \nsetting of components  (thus engaging in construction activity) and those t hat require  delivery of the \ncomponents and other building materials on the ground  (not a construction activity).\" (ID -0208.1.)

(See the discussion  of this \nprovision at 73 FR 59748 , Oct. 9, 2008.)      One commenter wrote that, to ensure safe assembly and \ndisassembly,  employer procedures must not be allowed. In the preamble to the  proposed rule, OSHA \nexplained its rationale and the basis of C-DAC's  recommendation that employer procedures be allowed where \nthey meet the  specified criteria in Sec.  1926.1406. (See full discussion at 73 FR  59742, 59748, Oct. 9, \n2008). The commenter did not challenge the  rationale or provide any evidence of why employer procedures \nthat  comply with S ec.  1926.1406 would be insufficient. The Agency is  therefore adopting Sec.  \n1926.1406 as proposed for the reasons  explained in the preamble to the proposed rule, with several minor  \nclarifications.     In Sec.  1926.1406(a), the phrase \"assembly/disasse mbly\" replaces  \"assembling or \ndisassembling\" to make this section consistent with  other sections of the rule. Also in Sec.  1926.1406(a), \nOSHA has  removed the phrase \"are designed to\" to increase clarity. In Sec.   1926.1406(a)(1), the phrase \n\"any part\" replaces \"all parts\" to make  it clear the duty to prevent dangerous movement in any part of the  \nequipment. This provision is otherwise promulgated as proposed with  several grammatical corrections.  \nSections 1926.1407-1926.1411 Power Lines Introduction     Final Sec. Sec.  1926.1407 through 1926.1411 \ncontain requirements  designed to help ensure the safety of employees while cranes/derricks  are being \nassembled, disassembled, operated, or while they travel under  power lines.     Previously, subpart N, in \nformer Sec.  1926.550(a)(15), addressed  power line hazards by specifying the minimum distance that must \nbe  maintained between a crane and an energized power line. For lines rated  50 kilovolts (kV) or below, the \nminimum distance was 10 feet; for lines  over 50 kV, the minimum distance was generally 10 feet plus 0.4 \ninches  for each 1 kV over 50 kV (we will refer to this subpart N requirement  in this preamble as the \"10 -\nfoot rule\").     However, the subpart N provisions, which instructed employers to  maintain a minimum \nclearance distance, did little by way of requiring  employers to implement measures to help prevent operators \nfrom  inadvertently breaching that distance. The only preventative measure in  subpart N was a requirement, \nin former Sec.  1926.550(a)(15)(iv), to  use a spotter \"where it is difficult for the operator to maintain the  \ndesired clearance by visual means.\" In discussing how to re duce power  line fatalities, the Committee \ndetermined that a systematic, proactive  approach to preventing power line contact is needed (see the \nAgency's  explanation for the need for these provisions in the proposed rule  preamble at 73 FR 59748-59750, \nOct. 9, 2008). Brief Overview of Requirements     The standard requires the implementation of a systematic, \nproactive  approach to dealing with the hazard of power lines. This approach is  comprised of the following \nsteps: (1) Identify the work zone and assess  it for power lines--determine how close the crane could get to \nthem. The  employer has the option of doing this assessment for the area 360 degrees  around the crane or \nfor a more limited, demarcated area; (2) If the assessment  shows that the crane could get closer than a trigger \ndistance--20 feet for  lines rated up to 350 kV (50 feet for lines rated over 350 kV) --then requirements  for \nadditional action will be triggered.      The voltages given in the final rule are phase -to-phase system  \nvoltages on the power lines. It should be noted that the system  voltages for power lines generally take three \nforms.",

Paragraph (c)(2) of this section closely \nparallels Sec.   1926.1424(a)(2)(ii) but omits the requirement that employers  demonstrate infeasibility \nbefore using a combination of warning signs  and high visibility markings in place of erecting and maintaining  \ncontrol lines, warning lines, railings, or similar boundaries of hazard  areas. Because equipment covered by \nthis section typically operates  within a very limited physical work space, employers often need  increased \nflexibility in determining which work area control method is  most appropriate in light of special site-specific \ncircumstances. To  help ensure that employees are adequately protected if the employer  uses high visibility \nmarkings to supplement warning signs, this  paragraph requires the employer to train employees to \nunderstand the  meaning of the markings.     OSHA received no comments on this provision as proposed. \nUpon  review of this provision, the Agency determined the two examples  provided in the regulatory text \nwere redundant. Therefore, except for  the removal of one of the examples, OSHA is retaining the provision",

Section 1926.1408(f) is modified  accordingly.     OSHA notes that former Sec.  \n1926.550(a)(15)(vii) of s ubpart N  required employers to provide crews \"with nonconductive poles having  \nlarge alligator clips or other similar protection to attach the ground  cable to the load.\" This requirement \nprotected employees from the  electric shock hazard that exists whe n employees apply grounds. Due to  \nwhat the Agency determined was an inadvertent oversight on the part of  the Committee, the proposed rule \ndid not contain provisions addressing  these hazards. Although no commenters raised this issue, OSHA is \naware  that employees are exposed to serious electric shock hazards when they  are attaching grounds in \naccordance with Sec.  1926.1408(f). For  example, when attaching the rigging to the load or the ground to \nthe  crane, the crane and load will be energized. OSHA vie ws this condition  as a recognized hazard and \nexpects employers to ensure that employees  are adequately protected when they are attaching grounds. \nEmployers who  fail to properly protect their employees in this regard will, in  appropriate circumstances, be \nsubject to citation under the General  Duty Clause (sec. 5(a)(1)) of the OSH Act.     It should also be noted \nthat work covered by Sec. Sec.  1926.1407  and 1926.1410 that is performed near transmitter or \ncommunication  towers can pose electric shock hazards similar to those addressed by  Sec.  1926.1408(f). \nDue to another oversight by the Committee, however,  neither Sec.  1926.1407 nor Sec.  1926.1410 \ncontains provisions  addressing these hazards. OSHA considers these to be recognized hazards  and will use \nits enforcement authority under the General Duty Clause,  as appropriate, to ensure that employers are taking \nmeasures, such as  those required in Sec. Sec.  1926.600(a)(6)(vii) or 1926.1408(f), to  protect employees \nfrom electric shock and fires while performing work  covered by Sec. Sec.  1926.1407 and 1926.1410 near \ntransmitter or  communication towers. OSHA will consider addressing both of these  oversights through \nfuture rulemaking.     A commenter suggested adding a provision to paragraph (f) whereby  the owner of \na transmitter communication tower would be required to  evaluate whether power level density levels were \nhigh enough to  endanger employees working near the tower and, if so, implement  precautions to prevent \nthem. (ID-0130.1.) The issue raised by this  comment is beyond the scope of this rule, which addresses hazards  \nrelated to the use of equipment and not employee exposure to possible  radiation hazards. Such hazards are \ncovered by Sec.  1926.54,  Nonionizing radiation. Paragraph (g) Training     Paragraph (g) of this section \nsets forth training requirements for  crane operators and other crew members assigned to work with the  \nequipment. The training topics listed are designed to ensure that both  the operator and the other crew \nmembers have the information they need  to help protect themselves from power line hazards. One \ncommenter  suggested that, in addition to the topics listed in the  proposed rule,  employees working on \nequipment operating closer than Table A clearance  distances also be trained on induction, step and touch \npotentials, and  proper equipment grounding procedures. (ID -0161.1.) Other commenters  also \nrecommended training in grounding procedures and in the  limitations of the protection that grounding \nprovides. (ID-0131.1; - 0155.1.) OSHA concludes that training on induction, step, and touch  potentials would \nget into issues that are highly technical and would  not help workers understand what they must do to protect \nthemselves and  others. OSHA does, however, agree with the suggestion that workers be  trained in proper \ngrounding procedures and in the limitations of the  protection that grounding provides. As discussed under \nSec.  1926.1410,  equipment grounding is one of the additional precautions required when  it is infeasible \nto maintain the Table A clearances, and training in  proper grounding procedures will help ensure the \neffectiveness of this  provision. In addition, employees must understand that grounding may  not afford \ncomplete protection. Accordingly, OSHA is adding a new Sec.   1926.1408(g)(1)(v) that requires training in the",

Therefore,  under \nthis provision, before any of these occur, the A/D director is  required to consider whether precautions need \nto be instituted to  ensure that backward stability is maintained. No comments were received  on this \nprovision. However, OSHA is not including the drawing described  as Figure 1 in the proposed rule. See the \ndiscussion of the removal of  this figure below in Sec.  1926.1405. Except for the removal of any  reference \nto figure 1, OSHA is promulgating the provision as proposed.  Paragraph (h)(12) Wind Speed and Weather      \nSection 1926.1404(h)(12) requires the A/D director to address  hazards caused by wind speed and weather to \nensure that the safe  assembly/disassembly of the equipment is not compromised.      The Committee \nconsidered the option of establishing a maximum wind  speed, as well as the option of incorporating ANSI's \nprovisions  regarding wind speed. However, it determined that selecting any one  particular speed as a \nmaximum would be arbitrary b ecause of the variety  of factors involved. For example: different cranes and \ncrane types vary  with respect to the \"sail\" area they present; an assembly process  involving use of an assist \ncrane may require lower wind speeds than one  in which no assist crane is used; and assembly/disassembly \noperations  done \"in the air\" (that is, with the boom elevated in the air,  without ground support for the \nboom) may require lower wind speeds than  a boom assembled/disassembled on the ground. The Committee \nultimately  decided that a better approach would be to have the A/D director  determine the maximum safe \nwind speed under the circumstances.      Other weather conditions that can affect the safety of assembly/  \ndisassembly would include, for example, ice accumulatio n on crane  components. Ice can both add to the \nweight of the components and create  slippery, dangerous surfaces on which employees work. The A/D \ndirector  must address weather conditions that affect the safety of the  operation. No comments were \nreceived on this provision; it is  promulgated as proposed with a slight rewording for clarity.  Paragraph (i) \n[Reserved.] Paragraph (j) Cantilevered Boom Sections      Members of the Committee determined that a \ncommon mistake in  assembly/disassembly is cantileveri ng too much boom. When too much boom  is \ncantilevered, structural failure can occur in components such as the  mast/gantry, boom sections and lifting \nlugs. Employees may be struck by  falling components from this type of failure. To prevent accidents from  \ncantilevering too much boom during assembly/disassembly, this provision  requires manufacturer's \nlimitations on cantilevering not to be  exceeded.     If the manufacturer's limitations are not available, the \nemployer  is required to have a registered professional engineer (RPE) determine  the appropriate limitations, \nand to abide by those limitations. The  Committee concluded that in such cases there  would need to be a  \nrequirement that the RPE's determination be in writing to ensure that  the assessment has been done.      \nThis provision is promulgated as proposed with one grammatical  correction to make it clear that it is the \nlimitations that must n ot be  exceeded. Paragraph (k) Weight of Components      As with any load to be \nlifted by a crane/derrick, the weight of the  components must be available to the operator so that the operator \ncan  determine if the lift can be performed within the crane/derr ick's  capacity.

No comments were received on this provision.

The  operator \nmust know the length of the boom because it affects the  crane's capacity, as shown on the load chart. At least \none of the  following must be used as a temporary alternative measures: mark the  boom with measured \nmarks to calculate boom length; calculate boom  length from boom angle and radius measurements; or \nmeasure the boom  with a measuring device.     Load Weighing and Similar Devices: Proposed paragraph \n(e)(4)  required load weighing and similar devices on all equipment with a  rated capacity over 6,000 pounds \nand manufactured after March 29, 2003  (except derricks; a comparable provision for derricks is in Sec.   \n1926.1436(f)(3), discussed below). The framework of this proposed  paragraph was similar to the approach \ntaken in sec. 5 -1.9.9.2 of ASME  B30.5-2004, respecting these aids. The proposed standard permitted  \nemployers to choose to outfit its equipment with either a load weighing  device, load moment (or rated \ncapacity) indicator, or a load moment or  rated capacity limiter. The latter two terms are defined in Sec.   \n1926.1401. All three devices are intended to help the operator avoid  exceeding the equipment's rated \ncapacity and thereby prevent the crane  from tipping over.      This proposed provision was limited to \nequipment (other than  derricks) manufactured after March 29, 2003. That was the date when  ASME B30.5 \nfirst called for all mobile cranes with a rated capacity  over 6,000 pounds to be equipped with load weighing \ndevices. The  proposed provision was thus keyed to the date when the industry first  began widely \nmanufacturing or equipping mobile cranes with load  weighing or load moment devices.      A trade \nassociation pointed out that ASME B30.5 does not apply to  articulating cranes and that the applicable \nconsensus standard, ASME  B30.22, does not require the devices specified in paragraph (e)(4).  (ID-0206.1.) \nThe commenter stated, however, that these are l ikely to be  required by the 2010 update of ASME B30.22.      \nAs discussed in Sec.  1926.1400, evidence in the record shows that  many articulating cranes are currently \nequipped with automatic overload  prevention devices which, like the devices specified in this section,  are \ndesigned to avoid the possibility of tipover. Therefore, the  tipover hazard addressed by paragraph (e)(4) can \nbe addressed for  newly-manufactured articulating cranes by requiring such cranes to be  equipped with \neither automatic overload prevention devices or one of  the devices specified in paragraph (e)(4). To achieve \nthis objective,  OSHA is therefore revis ing proposed paragraph (e)(4). The requirement  in proposed \nparagraph (e)(4) is revised to exclude articulating cranes  and is renumbered paragraph (e)(4)(i) in the final \nrule. New paragraph  (e)(4)(i) includes temporary alternative measures based on calculations  from sources \nrecognized by the industry. The proposed rule had provided  for calculations based on a \"reliable\" source or \ncalculation method,  or \"by other equally reliable means.\" To avoid the potentially subjective  interpretations \nof \"reliable,\" OSHA is instead requiring that the measurements  be from a source typically relied on in the \nindustry.     A new paragraph (e)(4)(ii), applicable to articulating cranes, is  added. This new paragraph \nrequires articulating cranes manufactured  more than one year after the effective date of the standard to be  \nequipped with either an automatic overload prevention device, a load  weighing device, a load moment (or \nrated capacity) indictor, or a load  moment (or rated capacity) limiter. Paragraph (e)(4)(ii) w ill protect  \nworkers against articulating cranes tipping over while giving employers  a choice of means to achieve this \nobjective.",

Several commenters stated that the requirements should remain as  originally proposed \nand the Agency should not allow notification  through a third person. (ID-0205.1; -0213.1; -0182.1; -0187.1; - \n0379.1.) One commenter believed that third party notification could  result in miscommunication or delays. \n(ID-0226; -0357.1.)     One commenter testified that introducing a third person into the  communications \nlink would not present any danger so long as there was  some verbal confirmation. (ID -0344.)     OSHA \nagrees with C-DAC and the majority of the commenters. Indirect  communication between the crane operator \nand th e employee working out  of view, through an intermediary, would increase the potential for  \nmiscommunication. Therefore, the Agency has not changed the provisions  to allow third party notification.     \nCommenters raised additional issues regarding Sec.  1 926.1404(e).  Proposed Sec.  1926.1404(e) provided \ntwo methods to assure that  employees would not be injured while working outside of the operator's  view. \nUnder proposed Sec.  1926.1404(e)(2)(i), the operator would give  a warning that is understood by the crew \nmember as a signal that the  equipment (or load) is about to be moved and would allow time for the  crew \nmember to get to a safe position. Under proposed Sec.   1926.1404(e)(2)(ii), the operator was prohibited \nfrom moving any part  of the crane until informed, in accordance with a pre -arranged system  of \ncommunication, that the crew member is in a safe position.     Two commenters raised concerns regarding \ncrew members actually  hearing warnings that were given in ac cordance with proposed Sec.   \n1926.1404(e)(2)(i). One commenter suggested that the operator should be  required to confirm that the \nemployee has moved to a safe location  prior to initiating crane movement. (ID-0292.1.) Another commenter  \nsuggested that a prearranged communications system should be required  because audible warnings can be \ndrowned out by ambient noise. (ID - 0122.)     These comments identified two flaws in proposed Sec.   \n1926.1404(e)(2)(i) that were not addressed by C -DAC. First, a crew  member may not hear a warning signal \nthat the equipment or load is  about to move and may not respond appropriately. Second, the crew  member \nmay hear the warning signal but be unable to move from his/her  position. This would leave the crew member \nexposed to struck-by and  crushing hazards. As a result, the Agency has revised the provision by  deleting the \noption that was in proposed Sec.  1926.1404(e)(2)(i).  Proposed Sec.  1926.1404(e)(2) is otherwise included \nas proposed except  for one grammatical corre ction. Paragraph (f) Working Under the Boom, Jib or Other \nComponents     Section 1926.1404(f) requires that when pins (or similar devices)  are being removed, \nemployees must not be under the boom, jib, or other  components, except where the employer demonstrates \nthat site  constraints require employees to be so positioned. In such instances  the A/D director must \nimplement procedures that minimize the risk of  unintended dangerous movement and minimize the duration \nand extent of  exposure under the boom. An example of such procedures is provided in  non-mandatory \nAppendix B. Paragraph (g) Capacity Limits     This provision requires that the rated capacity limits for loads  \nimposed on the equipment, each of its components (including rigging),  lifting lugs and equipment accessories \nbeing assembled or disassembled  not be exceeded. The provision applies \"during all phases of assembly/  \ndisassembly.\" (See the discussion of this provision at 73 FR 59744,  Oct. 9, 2008.)",

Neither of the  \naffected industry sectors has  objected to certifying operators of their truck-mounted cranes; yet if  it were \nnecessary that every lineman perform every function, that would  surely also necessitate certifying every \njourneyman as well. The Agency  concludes that it is not necessary to certify every journeyman as a  crane \noperator for the industry to continue to efficiently use their  equipment and manpower. If the industries are \nstill operating as many  as 20,200 powered vehicles, and about one -half are d igger derricks and  truck-\nmounted cranes, then, at the very bare minimum, to have an  operator in each piece of equipment potentially \ncovered by the final  standard would require certifying 10,100 as crane operators. However,  having the bare \nminimum, the Agency recognizes, would not afford the  industries the same flexibility and efficiency as it now \nhas nor is  every employee available to work every day of the year. However, the  Agency believes that",

However, \nbecause the Agency accounted for turnover of operators and  estimated costs for new operators as a result of \nretirement for the  industry, a simple five year annualization would overestimate costs. As  a result, the \nAgency introduced a factor to the formula to assure that  no costs were taken for recertification of retired \noperators. (See full  formulas in the FEA.)     Operator certification was the primary focus of comments on \ncosts.  Many commenters stated that in regard to the means of crane operator  certification Option (1), or \nthird-party testing, was the only viable  alternative. (See, e.g., ID -0151; -0342.) The Agency agrees that this  \nwill be the primary means of certification and notes there ar e several  testing organizations now available, \nwith more reportedly in the  process of being accredited. (ID-0341; -0343.)     Michael Eggenberger of Bay \nLtd provided several comments on the  unit cost of operator certification. (ID -0254.) Mr. Eggenberger   \nprovided photocopies of invoices that showed Bay Ltd paying for NCCCO  written and practical exams, over \ntwo days, for $1,375 each. The  invoice does not make clear whether the two days included prep  training, \nbut handwritten on each invoice is the addi tional information  that the invoice costs did not include prep \ntraining at $500, plus five  days' wages for each employee. The Agency concludes that Bay Ltd  provided a \ncourse of prep training and testing that lasted five days.  If Mr. Eggenberger's employees were paid the average \nwage (including  benefits) of $31.36 per hour that OSHA is relying on, based on BLS  data, then the total cost \nper employee would be $3,129 (about $1,250 in  wages, $1,375 for prep and the exam, and $500 in prep \ntraining.)     Edison Electric Institute, representing the electric utility  industry, submitted cost data for \ncertification \"utilizing $1,750 as  the base cost for a training course and the actual exam. EEI has  estimated \nthat it would cost approximately $1,500 for an emp loyee  training course, and $250 for the certification \nprogram.\" (ID-0345.17;  -0370.1.) EEI did not provide any detail about its figures.      Comment received \nfrom James Nevel of the National Utility Training  & Safety Education Association (NUTSEA) said that \"typical \ntraining  programs that we have seen run $1200 to $1400 for classroom training  and then an additional \n$450+ or so for the ce rtification testing.\"  (ID-0155.1.) NUTSEA's membership of 250 \"provides safety and \ntraining  services to most of the electric cooperatives in the United States.\"      California enacted a \nrequirement for crane operator certification  which took effect in June 2005. That State's operator certification \nrequirement  did not apply to digger derricks and mobile --usually truck-mounted-- cranes with a capacity \nbelow 15,000 pounds. The State estimated that  there were 5,000 mobile cranes and 700 tower cranes \naffected and that  about 10,000 operators would require certification (\"Economic Impact  Statement,\" \nAttachment 1 for Crane Operator Qualifications/ Certification, Economic and Fiscal Impact Statement, STD, 399).  \nCalifornia estimated that there were almost 2,000 businesses that  owned, operated, or leased cranes affected \nby the State's regulation.  Further, the State's impact report estimated that the cost of  certification would \ninclude a physical examination ($320), a substance  abuse test ($120), and cost of a written and practical exam \nfrom a  NCCCO testing agent ($550), or a total of $990 per operator.      The Agency received several \nestimates of the cost of operator  certification as part of the Small Business Advocacy Review Panel  (SBAR). \nJohn Anderson reported that he estimated certification costs at  $2,900 per employee, including five days for \ntraining, exam, and wages  (OSHA-S030A-2006-0064-0019), with the average cost of an exam $382 and  with \ntraining or prep courses $1,260 on average, and wages $1,255.

Paragraph (f)(2) Response to \"Do Not Operate\"/Tag-Out Signs     If there is a warning \nsign on the equipment or starting control,  paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section prohibits the operator from  \nactivating the switch or starting the equipment until the sign is  removed by someone authorized to remove \nit or until the operator can  verify that (A) no one is servicing, working on, or otherwise in a  dangerous \nposition on the machine, and (B) the equipment has been  repaired and is working properly. Similarly, under \nSec.   1926.1417(f)(2)(ii), when there is a warning sign on any other switch  or control, the operator will be \nprohibited from activating that switch  or control until the sign has been removed by an individual authorized  \nto remove it, or until the operator meets the two requirements of Sec.   1926.1417(f)(2)(i), described above.     \nThese provisions will prevent two types of hazards. First, since  the machine is out of service, there is a risk \nthat an employee  servicing, working on, or otherwise in a dangerous position on it is  not expecting it to be \nactivated and would be injured if it were  activated. Second, if an employee does not know that the equipment \nis  malfunctioning or has a function that is not working properly, an  employee could inadvertently try to \noperate it with the result that the  equipment will not work as intended, causing unintended movement or a  \ncollapse.     Subpart N of the former rule addressed this issue through sec. 5 - 3.1.3g of ANSI B30.5 -1968, \nwhich states: \"If there is a warning sign  on the switch or engine starting controls, the operator shall not close  \nthe switch or start the engine until the warning sign has been removed  by the person placing it there.\" Instead \nof requiring that the sign be  removed by the person who placed it, Sec.  1926.1417(f)(2) permits it  to be \nremoved by an authorized person and, as an alternative, permits  the operator to start the equipment after \nverifying that no worker is  in a dangerous area and that the equipment has been repaired and is  working \nproperly. OSHA concludes that either alternative would achieve  the safety purpose of the tag-out because it \nwould ensure that a  knowledgeable and re sponsible person, either the operator or another  authorized \nperson, verifies that repairs are complete and all workers  are in a safe position before the equipment can be \nstarted.     As discussed above, the operator will be permitted to start  equipment that is tagged out, or \nactivate a tagged -out switch, only if  the procedures specified in Sec.  1926.1417(f)(2)(i) are met. In  \nreviewing this provision during the proposal stage, the Agency noted  that these procedures were not as \ncomprehensive as those in the general  industry standard for the control of hazardous energy (lockout/tagout),  \nwhich are listed in Sec. Sec.  1910.147(e)(3)(i) through (iii). \\84\\ The  Agency requested public comment on \nwhether procedures similar to those  in Sec.

(See, e.g., Sec.  1926.1404(e).) Therefore, the Agency is not  \nincorporating the commenter's suggestion into Sec.  1926.1404(q) and is  promulgating the provision largely \nas proposed. Paragraph (r) Rigging      This paragraph specifies requirements regardi ng rigging during the  \ncrane assembly/disassembly process. It includes a requirement for a  qualified rigger and sets forth \nspecifications regarding the use of  synthetic slings.     C-DAC did not focus on the proper use of synthetic \nsling rigging  during the crane assembly/disassembly process, primarily because  another standard--29 CFR \n1926 Subpart H (Materials handling, storage,  use, and disposal) --already addresses some of the hazards \nassociated  with the use of synthetic slings in construction.     However, after C-DAC completed its work, a \ncatastrophic crane  collapse resulted in a reevaluation of subparts N and H with regard to  synthetic slings \nand rigging expertise. On March 15, 2008, a tower  crane in New York City collapsed, killing six construction \nworkers.  OSHA's investigation of that incident focused on the use of synthetic  slings to hold a bracing collar \nthat was being installed.     The Agency determined that neither subpart H (Rigging equipment for  material \nhandling) nor subpart N specifically address the hazard posed  when a synthetic sling is used in a manner \ncausing compression or  distortion of a sling, or when the sling is in contact with a sharp  edge. The Agency \nasked for public comment on whether to prohibit using  synthetic slings altogether in the \nassembly/disassembly process or,  alternatively, to require padding or similar measures to protect the  slings \nfrom being damaged (see 73 FR 59742, Oct. 9, 2008).     Commenters generally opposed prohibiting the use \nof synthetic  slings during assembly/disassembly, as long as appropriate precautions  are taken. (See, e.g., \nID-0205.1; -0213.1; -0343.) Specifically,  commenters s tated that synthetic slings have the advantage of \nhelping  to prevent damage to equipment components, but need to be protected  from cuts, compression, \ndistortion and reduction of capacity, by the  use of \"softeners\" (i.e., padding). (See, e.g., ID -0187.1; -0343.)  \nOne commenter testified that it does not oppose synthetic slings if  they are listed in the manufacturer's \nprocedures or if they are not  specifically prohibited by the manufacturer. (ID-0343.) Some commenters  also \nemphasized the need for such s lings to be properly rated and  inspected. (See, e.g., ID -0226.) Another \ncommenter recommended  requiring rigging equipment for material handling to be inspected. One  \ncommenter advocated prohibiting synthetic slings used in conjunction  with tower crane erection, unless the \nmanufacturer specifically allows  their use. (ID-0156.)     Commenters also suggested adding requirements \nregarding the  qualifications and training of riggers. Specifically, several  commenters suggested requiring \ncertification of riggers similar to  operator certification requirements in Sec.  1926.1427. (ID -0126; - 0132.1; \n-0136; -0204.1; -0311.1; -0362.1.) One commenter opposed  certification, but supported requiring training. \nAnother suggested  third party certification or licensing of supervisors. (ID -0156.1.)  Another advocated \nemployer qualification of riggers. (ID -0197.1.)     OSHA acknowledges that synthetic slings have cert ain \nadvantages,  such as preventing damage to equipment components, and no commenters  advocated a \nprohibition in all instances. OSHA has therefore decided  not to prohibit the use of synthetic slings in \nassembly/disassembly.  There must, however, be adequate safeguards for their use.     OSHA agrees with \nthe comment that stressed the importance of  inspecting slings. However, as Sec.  1926.251(a)(1) already \nrequires  that all rigging equipment be inspected, no additional requirement is  needed in subpart C C \nregarding the inspection and removal of synthetic  slings.",

These figures represent approximately  the median or average of \nestimates provided by EEI members, although  each member did not provide information about each \noperation. In  addition, the Agency had estimat ed the cost of using an insulating link  when working very \nclose to power lines as $427 per use. Comment in the  record showed that the average cost of these devices \nis lower than the  Agency's estimate in the PEA of $15,000, that their working lifetime is  20 years rather than \n10, and that they may require recertification each  year . (ID-0085; -0085.1; -0085.2.) Accordingly the Agency \nhas revised  its estimated cost per use to $210 (based on the information and model  in ID-0085, but with a \n7 percent discount rate). Although the final  standard may not require the use of NRTL -approved insulating \nlinks  until up to three years after the standard takes effect, the Agency is  including costs for this provision \nas if employers will replace their  inventory by purchasing and beginning use of NRTL -approved insulating  \nlinks in the first year that these links are available.      The Agency has also revised the costs of planning \nmeetings. In the  PEA the Agency concluded that four individuals would participate in  such a meeting. That \nmodel fits with operations of a traditional  lattice-boom crane. However, most cranes jobs today are of short  \nduration by truck -mounted cranes, and the Agency estimates that only  three individuals will typically be \ninvolved in a planning meeting. Operations Closer Than Table A Distance     The Agency received comment \nabout work close to power lin es that  has significantly increased its estimates of costs. (ID-0342; - 0345.17.) \nUnit costs for the time required of electric utilities or  professional engineers has been revised to $360 per \nepisode; costs of  de-activating or locking automatic line reclosure devices has been  increased from about \n$30 to $320, and the cost of supplying voltage  information is $200.      The Agency had estimated that \ncranes were performing operations  closer than 10 feet, or the Table A distance, in about 5 percent of all  \ncrane jobs that were not assembled near power lines (which was 75  percent of the total estimated 859,000 \ncranes jobs per year). In  testimony, EEI's David Highland, also from Allegheny Power, referred to  the \nfrequency of close-to-power-line work as OSHA's estimate of  \"50,000 episodes\" per year. The 50,000 figure \nwas also noted in EEI's  written testimony. (ID-0345.17.) However, OSHA's estimate of the actual  number (5 \npercent of 75 percent of 859,000) was approximately 32,000.  Mr. Highland also said, \"We thought it would \ndouble,\" in speaking of  the number of times construction employers would operate cranes closer  than the \nTable A distances.     The former OSHA standard at former Sec.  1926.550(a)(15) permitted  work near \npower lines no closer than 10 feet except where they are de - energized and grounded or when they have \n\"insulating barriers.\" If  power lines are not de-energized or do not have insulating barriers,  all parts of the \ncrane, line and load, must maintain a 10 -foot  clearance, with a designated person to observe clearance in \nsituations  where the crane operator would have difficulty ensuring clearance by  visual means; and \ninsulating links may be used as well (former Sec.   1926.550(a)(15(iv)). In oral testimony and written comment, \nEEI noted  that electric utilities provide line covers now for construction crane  operations, with practices \nvarying from region to region.  All electric  utilities make use of line hoses for protection. (ID -0342.) Mr.  \nHighland reported that his company gave \"free line hose up to a  certain length.",

The other commenters recommended that OSHA further clarify  the definition \nby requiring an evaluating entity to \"demonstrate\" its  competence through an independent body's audit, \ncertification, or  accreditation. (ID-0169.1; -0211.1.) OSHA agrees with C -DAC that  competence can be \ndemonstrated in a variety of ways and is not  establishing an accreditation requirement as for evaluators of \ncrane  operators. The assessment of a signal person's qualifications is  inherently less complex than the \nassessment of a crane operator's  qualifications because the range of signals and their applications are  more \nfinite than the wide assortment of scenarios and skills for which  a crane operator must be tested. As such, \nthe need for independent  assessment of the evaluator is diminished. Therefore, the Agency has  not made \nthe suggested changes; the definition is promulgated as  proposed except that the defined term is \"qualified \nevaluator (not a  third party)\" in the final rule.     Another commenter at the hearing, citing the availability \nof  experienced, trained signal persons in his organization, requested a  \"grandfather\" clause for signal \npersons so that previous training and  proof of hands -on practical experience would qualify signal persons  \nunder this rule, citing the availability of experienced, trained signal  persons in that organization. (ID-0345.17.) \nOSHA does not agree that a  \"grandfather\" clause is necessary or appropriate. The exp erienced,  trained \nworkers to which the commenter refers should be able to pass  the required assessment with little additional \ntraining.\\123\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\123\\ In many cases the only \nadditional training that likely  will be needed for those experienced and trained workers will be to  become \nfamiliar with the relevant requiremen ts of Sec. Sec.   1926.1419-1926.1422, and Sec.  1926.1428 \n(knowledge of that  information is required under Sec.  1926.1428(c)(4)).  ---------------------------------------------\n------------------------------      OSHA concurs with the C-DAC Committee's determination that it is  important \nfor employers to make the documentation of signal person  qualifications readily available to employees and \nothers who need to  rely on those qualifications, such as crane operators who rely on  signal persons \nprovided by a different employer, or OSHA for compliance  purposes. In proposed Sec.  1926.1428(a)(3), \nOSHA included C-DAC's  language requiring that the documentation be \"available,\" rather than  \"available at \nthe site,\" but noted that C-DAC intended that the  documentation be available at the site by, for example, the  \ndocumentation being physically present at the site or through use of an  on-site computer. OSHA asked for \npublic comment on changing the term  \"available\" to \"available at the site.\"     Two commenters objected \nto the proposed change, indicating that it  is not necessary to have the documentation on site so long as it can \nbe  readily produced. (ID-0205.1; -0222.1.) The commenters did not,  however, provide further explanation \nor cite any examples of how the  documentation would be \"readily produced\" quickly through means other  \nthan via computer. Moreover, the commenter's suggestion that documents  be \"readily produced\" is vague \nand could encompass documents that  might be \"produced\" offsite quickly but not transmitted in a timely  \nmanner to the work site. OSHA has decided to modify the language used  in the proposed rule and require in \nthe final rule that the  documentation be available at the site, and is also adding language to  make it clear \nthat the employer is responsible for making that  documentation available at the worksite.      In the \nproposed rule preamble, the Agency noted that the C-DAC  draft of Option (2) of this section did not explicitly \nstate that  documentation of the signal person's qualification by this method is  required. However, proposed \nSec.  1926.1428(a)(3) stated that \"the  documentation for whichever Option is used shall be available. * * *\"  \nIt was not clear to the Agency if C-DAC intended to require  documentation under Option (2) of this section as \nit did for Option  (1), or if it only intended that any documentation the employer chose  to create under \nOption (2) would have to be made available.

Another example is where the load  swing from the sudden stopping of the \ntrolley could cause the load to  fall and strike employees.      If this operational aid were not working \nproperly, the employer  would have to use one of two temporary alternative measures: (A) Mark  the trolley \nrope so it can be seen by the operator at a point that will  give the operator sufficient time to stop the trolley \nprior to the end  stops, or (B) use a spotter who is in direct communication with the  operator when \noperations are conducted within 10 feet of eit her end of the travel  rail end stops; the spotter must inform \nthe operator of the distance of  the travel bogies from the end stops or buffers.      Proposed Sec.  \n1926.1435(e)(5)(i)(B) did not explicitly require the  spotter to be in direct communication with the operator. \nThe Agency  proposed adding this language as necessary to make the provision work  effectively and as the \nCommittee intended and requested public comment  on whether to add specific language to that effect. Five \ncommenters  supported the addition of an explicit requirement that the spotter be  in direct communication \nwith the operator; no commenters opposed the  change. (ID -0069.1; -0156.1; -0180.1; -0205.1; -0213.1.) \nOSHA has  amended Sec.  1926.1435(e)(5)(i)(B) accordingly.      A similar change has been made to Sec. \nSec.  1926.1435(e)(5)(ii),  (e)(5)(iii), (e)(5)(iv), and (e)(5)(vii) discussed below, which also  provide for the use \nof a spotter as a temporary alternative measure  when certain operational aids are not functioning.     In \naddition, one commenter suggested there should be visual acuity  requirements for spotters. (ID-0069.1.) For \nthe reasons discussed  earlier under Sec.  1926.1408(b)(4)(ii), OSHA is not specifying such a  requirement \nin this rule.     Paragraph (e)(5)(ii) requires a boom hoist limiting device. As  defined in Sec.  1926.1401, \nthe word \"boom\" used in reference to  tower cranes refers to a luffing boom. Therefore, under this paragraph,  \na boom hoist limiting device would only be required on cranes with  luffing booms. A boom hoist limiting \ndevice automatically prevents the  boom hoist from pulling the boom past the minimum allowable radius  \n(maximum boom angle), which can result in boom f ailure (see the  discussion above of boom hoist limiting \ndevice with respect to Sec.   1926.1416(d)(1)). The temporary alternative measures for this  operational aid \nare similar to the ones for the trolley travel limiting  device and the boom hoist limitin g device in Sec.  \n1926.1416(d)(1): the  employer has the option of clearly marking the cable at a point that  would give the \noperator sufficient time to stop the boom hoist within  the minimum and maximum boom radius or use a \nspotter who is in direct  communication with the operator to inform the operator when this point  is reached.     \nParagraph (e)(5)(iii) requires an anti two-blocking device. This is  comparable to the requirement for anti two-\nblocking devices for other  cranes required by Sec.  1926.14 16. This operational aid is required on  tower \ncranes to prevent damage from contact between the load block,  overhaul ball, or similar component, and the \nboom tip (or fixed upper  block or similar component). Where the operational aid is not working  properly, \nthe employer has the option of clearly marking the cable at a  point that would give the operator sufficient \ntime to stop the hoist to  prevent two-blocking, or use a spotter who is in direct communication  with the \noperator to inform the operator when this point is reached.  (See the discussion of the need for this type of \ndevice, and rationale  for including it as an operational aid, above with respect to Sec.   1926.1416(d)(3)).     \nParagraph (e)(5)(iv) requires a hoist drum lower limiting device.",

Irrespective of whether the crane is initially erected to its full  height, or is \"jumped\" in \nstages, the process of increasing the  height of the crane is an assembly/erection process. Sections 1926.1403  \nthrough 1926.1406 apply whenever the crane's height is modified. To  ensure that this intent is reflected in \nthe standard, OSHA has added a  sentence to the definition of \"assembly/disassembly\" in Sec.   1926.1401 \nto this effect.      In proposed Sec.  1926.1401, \"assembly/disassembly\" was defined  to mean \"the \nassembly and/or disassembly of equipment covered under  this standard.\" With regard to tower cranes, \n'erecting and climbing'  replaces the term 'assembly,' and 'dismantling' replaces the term  'disassembly.' C-\nDAC did not originally include a definition of  \"assembly/disassembly,\" but OSHA included this definition in \nthe  proposed rule to avoid any implication that Sec. Sec.  1926.1403 - 1926.1406 do not apply to tower \ncranes because the terms \"assembly\"  and \"disassembly\" are not commonly used in the industry in referring  \nto tower cranes. Instead, the words \"erecting,\" \"climbing,\" and  \"dismantling,\" are used, and the definition of \n\"assembly/ disassembly\" makes it clear that Sec. Sec.  1926.1403 -1926.1406 also  apply to tower cranes.  \nSection 1926.1403 Assembly/Disassembly --Selection of Manufacturer or  Employer Procedures     Final \nSec.  1926.1403 requires that when assembling or  disassembling equipment (or attachments), the employer \nmust comply with  all manufacturer prohibitions applicable to assembly and disassembly  and must also \ncomply with either manufacturer procedures, or employer  procedures, for assembly and disassembly. \nEmployer procedures may be  used only where the employer can demon strate that the procedures used  \nmeet the requirements in Sec.  1926.1406 and may not be used during  rigging if the employer uses synthetic \nslings, as explained in the  discussion below regarding Sec.  1926.1404(r).      Two commenters suggested \nthat only manufacturer procedures for  crane assembly/disassembly be allowed. (ID-0151.1; -0305.1.) One of  \nthese commenters clarified its comment at the hearing (ID -0343.) and  confirmed this clarification in post -\nhearing submissions (ID-0387.1.)  that they did not believe the assembly/disassembly procedures should be  \nlimited to just manufacturer procedures. The commenter suggested using  a procedure designed by a \nregistered professional engineer or by a  qualified person. (ID-0387.1.) Note that Sec.  1926.1406(b) of the  \nfinal rule requires employer procedures to be developed by a qualified  person.     As explained in the \nproposed rule preamble, the Committee members  discussed whether employers should be  required to \ncomply with the  manufacturer's procedures, or if deviations from those procedures  should be allowed. The \nCommittee determined that deviations should be  allowed for two reasons. First, manufacturers' procedures \nare typically  designed for use in \"ideal\" environments: Large, flat, dry,  unencumbered open areas. However, \nin C-DAC's experience, such  conditions are not typical, especially in urban areas. Consequently,  employers \nare currently unable to implement those procedures in those  situations. Second, members were of the view \nthat there is often more  than one way to safely assemble and disassemble a crane, and that it is  \nunnecessary to mandate that in every case the manufacturer procedures  be used. The inclusion of specific \nrequirements in the standard that  employer procedures must meet (see Sec.  1926.1406) addresses the  \nconcern that those procedures ensure worker safety.      Another commenter suggested that employer \nprocedures not be allowed  for climbing operations unless approved b y the manufacturer. (ID- 0137.1.) As \nexplained in the discussion below regarding Sec.   1926.1404(r), the Agency has decided to require \nmanufacturer procedures  to be used with regard to the use of synthetic slings.",

In addition, as noted above for  \nthe Own but Do Not Rent sector, most employers in these sectors are  quite small, with only a few employees, \nand a relatively small fraction  of employers in the sectors that own cranes . Consequently, average  \nestablishment revenues and profits may be lower for the average  establishment than for establishments that \nown cranes. If so, the cost  as a percentage of profits overestimates that impact for affected  establishments.     \nThe Agency concludes that the final standard is economically  feasible for the affected industries. As described \nabove, a standard is  economically feasible if there is a reasonable likelihood that the  estimated costs of \ncompliance \"will not threaten the existence or  competitive structure of an industry, even if it does portend \ndisaster  for some marginal firms.\" United Steelworkers of America v. Marshall,  647 F.2d 1189, 1272 (DC Cir . \n1980). The potential impacts on employer  costs associated with achieving compliance with the final standard \nfall  well within the bounds of economic feasibility in each industry sector.  Costs of 0.2 percent of revenues \nand 4 percent of profits will not  threaten the existence of the construction industry, affected general  \nindustry sectors, or the use of cranes in affected industry sectors.  OSHA does not expect compliance with the \nrequirements of the final  standard to threaten the viability of employers or the competitive  structure of \nany of the affected industry sectors. When viewed in the  larger context of the construction sector, an increase \nin costs of  $148.2 million a year is effectively negligible, and will have no  noticeable effect on the demand \nfor construction services. Even when  viewed as an increase in the costs of using cranes, an increase in the  \ncost of rentals services of 0.2 percent will not cause the construction  industry to forego the use of cranes and, \nthus, put crane leasing firms  out of business.     For several reasons, the Agency believes that the impact \nof  compliance costs will be less than estimates in Table B -12. For the  affected construction sectors, the \neconomic impact of the final  standard is most likely to consist of a very small increase in prices  for \nconstruction projects involving work with cranes (0.2 percent or  less, depending on the sector). Crane rental \ncompanies, all of which  must incur the costs of compliance unless they are al ready in  compliance, should \nbe able to pass through costs to lessees. The  additional costs of crane safety measures are extremely small in  \nrelation to the value of construction, and there are no economic  substitutes, or alternatives, to the use of \ncranes in construction. It  is unlikely that a price increase of this magnitude would significantly  alter the \nservices demanded by the public or any other affected  customers or intermediaries. If the compliance costs \nof the final  standard are substantially recouped with an increase in rental prices,  there would be little effect \non profits. Impacts on all affected  general industry sectors are slight, and far below any test of economic  \nfeasibility.     Given the small incremental increases in prices potentially  resulting from compliance with \nthe final standard, and the lack of  readily available substitutes for the products and services provided by  the \ncovered construction and general industry sectors, demand is  expected to be sufficiently inelastic in each \naffected industry to  enable entities to substantially offset compliance costs through minor  price increases \nwithout experiencing any significant reduction in   revenues or profits.  Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis      \nThe Regulatory Flexibility Act, as amended in 1996, requires the  preparation of a Final Regulatory Flexibility \nAnalysis (FRFA) for specified  proposed rules (5 U.S.C. 601-612). Under the provisions of the law, each  such \nanalysis must contain:     (1) A description of the impact of the rule on small entities;      (2) A succinct \nstatement of the need for, and objectives of, the  rule;     (3) A summary of the significant issues raised by \nthe public  comments in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis, a  summary of the assessment \nof the agency of such issues, and a statement  of any changes made in the proposed rule as a result of such",

However, to be  consistent with the requirements of Sec.  1926.1403, the word  \n\"prohibition\" has been added to Sec.  1926.1404(m)(1)(i); otherwise,  it is promulgated as proposed with the \naddition of commas to clarify  that this paragraph only applies to the selection of components and  \nconfiguration to the extent that either one affects the capacity or  safe operation of the equipment.     Note \nthat another section (Sec.  1926.1434) allows cranes/derricks  to be modified under certain circumstances. \nTo the extent a crane/ derrick is modified in accordance with Sec.  1926.1434, the employer is  not required \nto follow the manufacturer's original instruct ions,  limitations and specifications regarding component \nselection and  configuration regarding those modifications. Instead, under Sec.   1926.1404(m)(1)(ii), the \nemployer is required to follow the component  selection and configuration requirements appr oved in \naccordance with  Sec.  1926.1434.  Paragraph (n)     For clarity, OSHA has reserved this paragraph and \nincorporated its  substance in Sec.  1926.1403, as explained above in the discussion  regarding Sec.  \n1926.1403. (See the discussion of this provi sion at 73  FR 59747, Oct. 9, 2008.)  Paragraph (o) Shipping Pins     \nThis provision requires reusable shipping pins, straps, links and  similar equipment to be removed. Once they \nare removed they must either  be stowed or otherwise stored so that they do n ot present a falling  object \nhazard. No comments were received for this paragraph; it is  promulgated as proposed. Paragraph (p) Pile \nDriving     This provision prohibits equipment used in pile driving operations  from having a jib attached. \nAn attached jib could be dislodged during  pile driving operations and cause structural damage to the boom,  \npotentially causing the boom to fail or diminishing its capacity. (See  the discussion of this provision at 73 FR \n59748, Oct. 9, 2008.) No  comments were received on this provision; it is promulgated as  proposed. \nParagraph (q) Outriggers and Stabilizers     This paragraph specifies requirements regarding outriggers. (See  \nthe discussion of this paragraph at 73 FR 59748, Oct. 9, 2008.)      OSHA received several comments with \nregard to Sec.  1926.1404(q)(2)  in relation to stabilizers. One commenter stated that it is necessary  to add \nthe term \"stabilizers\" to the regulatory tex t for the  provision to properly apply to articulating cranes. (ID -\n0206.1.) The  commenter explains that, as opposed to outriggers, which are designed  to take all load off of \nthe tires, stabilizers are designed to relieve  some, but not all, of the sprung  weight for the purpose of \nincreasing  the stability of the vehicle. The commenter believes that the provision  as written in the proposed \nrule would lead to improper use of  stabilizers in such a way that is dangerous and against manufacturer  \nrecommendations. A second commenter emphasized that cranes equipped  with stabilizers (and not \noutriggers) do not raise the wheels off the  ground. (ID-0292.)     OSHA agrees with the commenters that \nit is necessary to address  stabilizers in Sec.  1926.1404(q). With  the exception of Sec.   1926.1404(q)(2), \nthe term \"stabilizers\" has been added so that each  provision also applies to stabilizers. Section \n1926.1404(q)(2) does not  apply to stabilizers because they are not designed to remove all weight  from the \nvehicle's wheels.     One comment was received in regards to Sec.  1926.1404(q)(4). Under  that provision, \neach outrigger must be visible to the operator or to a  signal person during extension and setting. The \ncommenter suggested  that the requirement be modified so that it would also apply to the  retraction of \noutriggers. (ID-0053.1.)",

However, Sec.   \n1926.1431(b)(2) contains exceptions to the use a personnel platform and  one such exception, specified by \nSec.  1926.143 1(b)(2)(iii), applies  when an employer transfers an employee to or from a marine worksite in  \na marine -hoisted personnel-transfer device. Under the definition in  Sec.  1926.1401, \"marine worksite\" \nincludes a worksite in the water;  therefore, the excepti on specified by Sec.  1926.1431(b)(2)(iii) to the  \nrequirement to use a personnel platform applies when a diver is hoisted  into or out of the water in a marine-\nhoisted personnel-transfer device.     OSHA received no comments on any of the provisions in pr oposed  \nparagraph (j). Accordingly, OSHA is retaining these provisions in the  final rule because, in the Committee's \nview, use of a personnel  platform could be infeasible or more hazardous to employees than an  alternative \nmeans of hoisting personnel such as marine-hoisted  personnel-transfer devices (see the discussion above in \nthis preamble  for Sec.  1926.1431(b)(2)(iii)).

This reflects certain \ninherent characteristics of the assembly/ disassembly process that preclude the employer from being able to  \nreliably maintain clearance distances closer than Table A of Sec.   1926.1408. For example, when \ndisassembling a lattice boom, pins that  hold boom sections together are removed. Even when done properly, \nthis  can release stored kinetic energy and cause the boom section being  removed, as well as the remaining \nsections, to move. It is too  difficult to estimate the amount of such potential movement with the  precision \nthat would be necessary when working closer than the Table A  distances.     Another example is when \nassembling a boom, an error in the assembly  process may similarly cause unanticipated movement. Using \nclearances  closer than those in Table A would not allow sufficient room in light  of the difficulty of predicting \nthe amount of such movement. \\37\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\37\\ In \nthis respect this provision differs from Sec.   1926.1410. As discussed below, Sec.  1926.1410 allows use of \nminimum  clearance distances closer than Table A in some circumstances for  crane \"operations.\" In contrast, \nSec.  1926.1407(d) reflects a  determination by the Committee th at there are no circumstances for  \n\"assembly/disassembly\" when it would be safe for any part of the  crane, load or load line (including rigging \nand lifting accessories)  to get closer than the Table A minimum clearance distance. ---------------------------------\n------------------------------------------      This paragraph is being adopted as proposed.  Paragraph (e) Voltage \nInformation     This section operates in conjunction with Sec.  1926.1407(a)(3).  Under Sec.  \n1926.1407(a)(3), employers who elect to use Option (3) of  Sec.  1926.1407(a) must determine the line's \nvoltage. Under Sec.   1926.1407(e), where the employer asks the utilit y owner/operator for  that voltage \ninformation, the utility owner/operator of the line is  required to provide the voltage information within two \nworking days of  the request.\\38\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\38\\ One \ncommenter suggested that utility owners/operators be  required to label all power lines with voltage \ninformation. (ID - 0143.1.) OSHA rejected this suggestion because it believes the cost  of labeling every \noverhead power line in the country would be  prohibitive. -------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------      This reflects a conclusion of the Committee that, in the absence of  such a time limitation on the \nutility owner/operator, in many instances  Option (3) Sec.  1926.1407(b) would not be useful because the \nemployer  would not be able to get the voltage information in sufficient time to  be able to use it. Many \nemployers will rely on the utility owner/ operator to get this information. The Committee was concerned that \nan  extended delay in getting it would result in employers, to some extent,  doing the work anyway without \nthe information. Therefore, for Option  (3) Sec.  1926.1407(b) to be viable, the Committee concluded that a  \nreasonable time limitation for the utility owner/operator to respond  was needed.\\39\\ -----------------------------\n----------------------------------------------      \\39\\ As noted in the introduction, C -DAC included two members  \nfrom the electric utility industry.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      Some utility \nowner/operators asserted that OSHA cannot require them  to provide voltage information because OSHA \ndoes not have authority to  impose such requirements on an electric utility that does not have  employees \nat the construction site in question. (ID -0166.1; -0203.1; - 0226.1.)     OSHA's authority to require that \nelectric utilities disclose  voltage information derives from secs. 6(b) and 8(g)(2) of the Act.  While sec. 6(b) \ngenerally authorizes the Secretary to promulgate and  enforce occupational safety and health standards, sec. \n6(b)(7)  specifically permits the S ecretary to \"prescribe the use of labels or  other appropriate forms of \nwarning as are necessary to insure that  employees are apprised of all hazards to which they are exposed * *",

Section \n1926.1435(e)(6)(ii) requires tower cranes to have a trolley  travel deceleration device that would automatically \nreduce the trolley  speed before the trolley reaches the end limit in both directions.  Section \n1926.1435(e)(6)(iii) requires tower cranes to have a boom hoist  deceleration device, which would \nautomatically reduce the boom speed  before a luffing boom reaches the minimum or maximum radius limit.  \nSection 1926.1435(e)(6)(iv) requires tower cranes to have a load hoist  deceleration device, which would \nautomatically limit the load speed  before the load hoist reaches the upper limit.

The Agency  did not \nestimate costs for work near power lines within Table A  distances for the electric utility industries, power line \nconstruction,  and electric contractors, as these employers work near power lines  under subpart V.     The \nAgency has revised estimates of unit costs for some operations  near power lines. There were two primary \nsources for the revision of  some unit costs of power line work: the written submission by Edison  Electric \nInstitute (EEI) reporting cost information from 16 members and  the testimony and written comment from EEI \nitself. (ID-0343; -0345.17.)  Based on the EEI member's information, the Agency concludes that the  cost of",

The purpose of this paragraph is to determine if the structural  \nintegrity of the personnel platform is intact or if it has been  affected by any c ondition, damage, repair or \nmodification which could  result in structural failure or other safety hazards from the platform  or rigging. \nThis ensures the load lowering and braking mechanisms are  functioning properly before personnel are lifted. \nIn additi on, Sec.   1926.1431(j)(3) clarifies that only deficiencies that present a safety  hazard need be \ncorrected; minor deficiencies bearing no relation to  safety do not need to be corrected.     In addition, the \nAgency is adding a reference to the requirement s  of Sec.  1926.1417, Operation, to ensure the reader is \naware of the  applicable tagout and startup requirements of Sec.  1926.1417,  Operation. Paragraph (j)(3) \nof this section is otherwise promulgated as  proposed.     One commenter stated that proof testing should \nnot be required for  boom attached personnel platforms, since there is no rigging and a  simple visual \ninspection of the mounting hardware would be sufficient.  (ID-0144.1.)     OSHA disagrees with this \ncomment. The purpose of this proof test is  to ensure the sufficiency and integrity of the system that will be  \nhoisted by the crane/derrick. In the case of a suspended platform, that  system consists of the platform and \nthe rigging that attaches it to the  crane/derrick. In the case of a boom -attached platform, that system  \nconsists of the platform with its boom -mounting hardware (in such cases  OSHA considers the boom -\nmounting hardware part of the platform itself).  Therefore, even when rigging is not used, the proof test still \nneeds to  be performed to help ensure the adequacy of the platform, including its  attachment system.     \nTherefore, Sec. Sec.  1926.1431(j)(1), (2) and (4) are promulgated  as proposed. Paragraph (k) Work practices     \nParagraph (k)(1) of this section requires hoisting the personnel  platform in a slow, controlled, cautious manner, \nwith no sudden  movements of the equipment or platform. This precaution minimizes the  likelihood of \nplatform tipping, loss of footing, and loss of control  of  the platform by the operator during hoisting.      \nParagraph (k)(2)(i) requires that all occupants of the personnel  platform keep all parts of the body inside the \nplatform while it is  being raised, lowered or moved horizontally. This does not apply w hen a  platform \noccupant must position the platform. Additionally, this does  not apply when a platform occupant is \nperforming the duties of a signal  person. The purpose of this requirement is to prevent an employee from  \nhaving a body part struck by or c aught in between the personnel  platform and another object.      \nParagraph (k)(2)(ii) prohibits platform occupants from standing on,  sitting on, or working from any surface \nother than the floor of the  personnel platform during hoisting or when working from the platform.  It \nprohibits working from a railing or toeboard or the use of any means  or device to raise the employee's \nworking height. The purpose is to  ensure that the occupants benefit from the protections of the guardrail  \nsystem and do not destabilize the platform.     Paragraph (k)(2)(iii) prohibits platform occupants from pulling \nthe  platform out of plumb in relation to the  hoisting equipment. The  purpose is to prevent tipping of the \nplatform with employees on board,  which could exacerbate the fall hazard.     Paragraph (k)(3) requires a \npersonnel platform that is not landed  to be secured to the structure, before employee s enter or exit the  \nplatform, to prevent dangerous movement of the platform at these times,  which could exacerbate the fall \nhazard or cause an employee's body part  to be struck by or caught in between the personnel platform and \nthe  structure. Paragraph (k)(3) allows an exception when a greater hazard  is created by securing the \nplatform to the structure.      Paragraph (k)(4) requires the operator to receive confirmation that  the \nplatform is no longer tied to the structure and is freely suspended  before the operator moves the platform. \nThis requirement prevents  structural damage to the platform and/or rigging and prevents the fall  hazard",

See sec. 5 -\n3.1.3(d) of ASME B30.5 -2004,  \"Mobile and Locomotive Cranes,\" sec. 2 -3.1.7 of ASME B30.2 -2001,  \n\"Overhead and Gantry Cranes,\" sec. 3 -3.1.3(d) of ASME B30.3 -1996,  \"Construction Tower Cranes,\" sec. 6 -\n3.2.3 of ASME B30.6-2003,  \"Derricks,\" and other standards in the ASME B30 series. --------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------      One commenter argued that OSHA lacks the authority to promulgate  \nSec.  1926.1418. \\89\\ (ID-0232.1.) First, the commenter contended that  the provision exceeds the Agency's \nstandards-setting authority under  sec. 3(8) of the OSH Act. Second, it expresses concern that Sec.   \n1926.1418 circumvents the limitations on OSHA's ability to grant  employees (i.e., crane operators) stop-work \nauthority. In support of  its position, the commenter cited the U.S. Supreme Court opinions in  Industrial \nUnion Dep't, AFL-CIO v. American Petroleum Institute \\90\\  and Whirlpool Corp. v. Marshall \\91\\. ---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------      \\89\\ The commenter nominated a C -DAC member who \ndid not dissent  on this section of the standard. The commenter has not explained why  it has changed its \nposition from the one taken by their C -DAC member  during negoti ations. In light of the unexplained \ninconsistency of  its position, the Agency accords diminished weight to the  commenter's comment and is \nhesitant to rely on it to undermine the  product of the negotiation.     \\90\\ 448 U.S. 607 (1980).     \\91\\ \n445 U.S.  1 (1980).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      OSHA disagrees with the \ncommenter's contention that OSHA lacks the  authority to promulgate Sec.  1926.1418. Under sec. 3(8) of \nthe OSH Act  and applicable case law,\\92\\ the Agency has broad authority to  promulgate standards that are \nreasonably necessary or appropriate to  provide safe or healthful places of employment. In Whirlpool Corp., \nthe  U.S. Supreme Court stated that the Act \"does not wait for an employee  to die or become injured.\" \\93\\ \nSection 1926.1418 is an essential  mechanism for preventing fatalities and injur ies. It enables the person  \nwho has the expertise to recognize a safety concern and is best  positioned to act quickly to do so where such \na concern arises. \\94\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\92\\ E.g., Indus. Union \nDep't, AFL-CIO, 448 U.S. at 611 -12.     \\93\\ 445 U.S. at 12.      \\94\\ As stated above, current consensus \nstandards manifest the  industry's recognition of the necessity for a crane operator to have  such authority. \nIn concert with Sec.  1926.1400 (f), Sec.  1926.1418  requires the employer to authorize its crane operator \nto halt  operations upon a safety concern until a qualified person determines  that safety has been assured. \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------      OSHA also disagrees with the commenter's \ncontention that Sec.   1926.1418 impermissibly grants stop -work authority, as well as a  different \ncommenter who asserted that the wording of the provision is  too vague and could lead to an abuse of the \noperator's authority. Both  commenters suggested that OSHA limit the operator's authority to  specific \nreasons involving a potential violation of a requirement in  subpart CC. (ID -0218.1; 0232.1.)      The \nprovision does not authorize an operator to stop operations for  reasons unrelated to a good faith belief that \nthere may be a safety  problem.",

Compliance with this \nrequirement will increase the  likelihood that employees will recognize the hazard identified on the  posted \nwarning and avoid or protect themselves from that hazard. -------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------      \\130\\ Two commenters stated that posted warnings originally  supplied with the equipment by \nthe manufacturer should not be  included in this provision and were not agreed to by C-DAC; they  believed \nthat C-DAC required only original posted warnings related  to electrical hazards. (ID-0205.1; -0222.1.) These \ncommenters are  mistaken; the proposed language is unchanged from the C -DAC  consensus document. In \nany event, OSHA believ es that maintenance of  manufacturers' original posted warnings is critical to safe  \noperation of equipment and is promulgating this provision as  proposed. -----------------------------------------------\n----------------------------      Section 1926.1433(d)(6) requires that an accessible fire  extinguisher be on the \nequipment to eliminate small fires quickly. This  provision continues a similar requirement that was in the \nformer Sec.   1926.550(a)(14)(i).     Section 1926.1433(d)(7), Cabs, states that equipment with cabs must  \nmeet the requirements listed in Sec.  1926.1433(d)(7)(i) through (v) of  this section. These provisions ensure \nthat the crane operator is  provided with a safe work station that has adequate ventilation, safe  means of \naccess and egress, good visibility, protection against window  breakage, and sufficient roof strength. Most of \nthese requirements  continue the protections provided under OSHA's prior rules for crawler,  locomotive, \nand truck cranes, which incorporated by reference vario us  sections of ANSI B30.5 -1968.     Section \n1926.1433(d)(7)(i) requires that cabs be designed with a  form of adjustable ventilation and method for \nclearing the windshield  for maintaining visibility and air circulation. Examples of means for  adjustable \nventilation include an air conditioner or window that can be  opened (for ventilation and air circulation); \nexamples of means for  maintaining visibility include heater (for preventing windshield  icing), defroster, fan, \nand windshield wiper. This provision ensures  adequate air circulation, both for the operator's health and for \ngood  visibility.     Under Sec.  1926.1433(d)(7)(ii), cab doors (whether swinging or  sliding) mu st be \ndesigned to prevent inadvertent opening or closing  while traveling or operating the machine. Swinging doors \nadjacent to  the operator must open outward. Sliding operator doors must open  rearward. Standardization \nof the direction for opening doors h elps  ensure that an operator will be able to exit the cab quickly in an  \nemergency.     Section 1926.1433(d)(7)(iii), Windows, requires that cab windows  meet the requirements \nlisted in Sec. Sec.  1926.1433(d)(7)(iii)(A)  through (C).     Section 1926.1433(d)(7)(iii)(A) requires that the \ncab have windows  in front and on both sides of the operator. Forward vertical visibility  must be sufficient \nto give the operator a view of the boom point at all  times.     Section 1926.1433(d)(7)(iii)(B) allows \nwindows to have sections  designed to be opened or readily removed. Windows with sections  designed to \nbe opened must be designed so that they can be secured to  prevent inadvertent closure. Compliance with \nthis provision ensures  that the operator can adequately ventilate the cab should conditions  within the cab \naffect the safe operation of the crane.      Section 1926.1433(d)(7)(iii)(C) specifies that windows be  \nconstructed of safety glass, or material with similar optical and  safety properties, that introduces no visible \ndistortion or otherwise  obscures visibility. In the final rule, OSHA has deleted the phrase  \"that interferes \nwith the safe operation of the crane\" from the end  of this paragraph as proposed to eliminate an ambiguity \nthat might  arise in interpreting this provision.",

Under paragraph (e)(3)(ii), the qualification is  valid for the time period specified by the \nlicensing entity, but for no  longer than five years.      Several commenters expressed the concern that \nOSHA's new standard  would preempt existing State or local laws, particularly those relating  to licensing of \ncrane operators. Others encouraged the Agency to  expressly preempt those laws. The preemption issue is  \ndiscussed in full  at the end of this preamble within section V.D addressing federalism. Other Recommended \nOptions     Commenters recommended that OSHA offer employers two additional  options for qualifying \nor certifying operators. One is to allow  employers to self-certify operators based on their own evaluation of  \nthe operator's ability. For the reasons discussed in the introduction  to this section, OSHA rejects that \nsuggestion.     A number of commenters recommended that OSHA expand the range of  options by \nallowing an accredited educational institution to certify  operators. (ID-0105.1; -0147.1; -0151.1; -0187.1; -\n0193.1.) At the  public hearing, a witness for a trade association further recommended  an option whereby \noperators could be trained and qualified through an  employer program developed by an accredited \neducational institution.  (ID-0343.)     Some commenters believed that additional options were needed  \nbecause they believed that Option (1) was the only viable option for  many employers and that an insufficient \nnumber of accredited testing  organizations existed to meet the demand that an OSHA rule would  create. \n(ID-0165.1; -0187.1; -0193.1.)     OSHA notes that an educat ional institution, like any other testing  \norganization, may become an accredited testing organization under  Option (1) by becoming accredited by a \nnationally recognized  accrediting agency based on the criteria listed under that option and  complying with \nthe \"firewall\" requirements of Sec.  1926.1427(g).  However, OSHA determines the comments favoring this \nconcept were  addressing OSHA's request for comment on whether to allow an  educational institution to \ncertify operators based solely on its  accreditation by an organization recognized by the Department of  \nEducation (DoE) without the need to be accredited under Option (1) (see  73 FR 59812, Oct. 9, 2008).      \nOSHA concludes that accreditation of an educational institution  under DoE criteria is insufficient to ensure \nthat a certification  issued by the institution would reliably demonstrate that the crane  operator has the \nknowledge and skills needed for safe operation. The  fundamental reason is that the accreditation process for \neducational  institutions does not include an assessment of an institution's ability  to assess personnel \ncompetency.     A representative from a consensus standard organization addressed  this issue at the public \nhearing. The representative had exp erience  both in accrediting educational institutions and personnel  \ncertification organizations. (ID-0344.) He testified that the  accreditation of an educational institution under \nthe DoE system is  designed to assess the quality of the education an inst itution offers  but does not \ndetermine whether the individuals who have attended that  institution possess the specific skills or \ncompetencies required for  particular jobs. Unlike an educational institution, which focuses on  the number \nof graduates, attr ition rates, and the percentage pass rate  on any national certification or State licensure \nexaminations, a  personnel certification program is designed to address competency for  job performance. \nAmong the concerns cited by the representative were  that the accreditation for an educational program does \nnot assess  competency, and that the tests administered by an educational program  are not held to the same \npsychometric standards as those administered  by an accredited personnel certification program. The  \ncommenter said  higher education accreditation is concerned with the quality of  education. Personnel \ncertification accreditation, on the other hand,  evaluates the quality of assessments to measure the \nacquisition and  ongoing maintenance of valid job co mpetencies. (ID -0344.)

Specifically, the commenter stated that (1)  The term \"adjacent to the equipment\" needed to be \nfurther explained  or quantified; (2) further guidance was needed to explain the meaning  of the phrase \"a \nperiod of time exceeding normal operations;\" (3) the  Agency needs to clarify that the equipment operator \ncan be the  \"competent person\" referred to in this section; and (4) the proposed  requirement to erect \nbarriers or caution lines to prevent employees  from entering fall zones are infeasible in many construction \nzones.     Regarding the commenter's first two points, in light of the extreme  variability of equipment types, \nloads lifted, and construction site  conditions, OSHA determines it is not possible  to use more precise  \nlanguage without making the rule underinclusive and/or overinclusive.  Specifying a precise distance in lieu of \nsaying \"adjacent to the  equipment,\" and a precise time in lieu of \"a period of time exceeding  normal \noperations,\" as the commenter suggests, would not be practical  in light of the numerous variables that affect \nthese distances and  times on construction sites. OSHA also rejects the commenter's  suggestion that the \nprevious prohibition be retained if it is not  possible to use more precise language. OSHA concludes that this \nis an  area where employers can be afforded flexibility without detracting  from safety, and that the limited \nconditions under which it is  permissible to leave a suspended load unattended will accomplish  this  \nobjective.     Regarding the third point, the answer is \"yes,\" an equipment  operator can be a \"competent \nperson\" for purposes of this section if  he or she meets the requirements of the Sec.  1926.1401 definition \nof  that term. Finally, where conditions in a construction site exist that  prevent erection of barriers or caution \nlines as prescribed by this  section, Sec.  1926.1417(e) prohibits employers from using this  exception to the \ngeneral prohibition of leaving suspended loads  unattended.     Proposed paragraph (e)(2) stated that the \nprovisions in paragraph  (e) do not apply to working gear, which includes slings, spreader bars,  ladders, and \nwelding machines, where the load is not suspended over an  entrance or exit.     The Agency noted in the \nproposal that the reference to paragraph  (e) was a drafting error and that the appropriate reference was to  \nparagraph (e)(1). In addition, the provision as proposed contained two  incidences of the word \"not\" which \ncould lead to confusion.  Therefore, the Agency noted in the proposal that it was considering  changing the \nlanguage to state that the provisions in Sec.   1926.1417(e)(1) do not apply to working gear where the working \ngear is  suspended over an area other than an entrance or exit.     In the proposed rule, OSHA noted that \nit was common practice for  employers to leave lightweight items suspended overnight to prevent  theft and \nstated that this provision was only intended to apply to  working gear whose weight was negligible relative to \nthe capacity of  the equipment. Four commenters believed that the proposed wording of  Sec.  \n1926.1417(e)(2) was overly broad to accomplish this purpose  because it did not limit the weight of the \nsuspended working gear  relative to the capacity of the equipment and could therefore allow a  load that \nplaced a significant strain on the equipment to be suspended  overnight. (ID-0122.1; -0172.1; -0178.1; -\n0199.1.) OSHA agrees with  these commenters that this provision should be clarified and, in the  final rule, \nhas made explicit what was stated in the preamble to the  proposed rule: that the provision only applies where \nthe weight of the  working gear is negligible relative to the lifting capacity of the equipment. Paragraph (f) Tag-\nOut Paragraph (f)(1) Tagging Out of Service Equipment/Functions      Where the employer has taken the \nequipment out of service, this  paragraph requires that the employer place a tag in the cab stating  that the \nequipment is out of service and is not to be used. Where the  equipment remains in service but the employer \nhas taken a function out  of service, this paragraph requires that the employer place a tag in a  conspicuous \nposition stating that that function is out of service and  is not to be used. This paragraph is designed to prevent \nhazards  associated with workers inadvertently attempting to use out -of-service  equipment or a function",

Paragraph (f)(6) requires  the employer to \ncheck the deficiencies in the monthly inspections that  the qualified person had identified as needing \nmonitoring.     In the proposed rule, OSHA discussed an apparent conflict between  Sec.  1926.1412(f)(4) \nand Sec.  1926.1416. Paragraph (f)(2)(v) lists  operational aids among the items that must be included in the \nannual  inspection.\\73\\ Section 1926.1416 permits equipment with operational  aids that are not \nfunctioning properly to continue to be used for  limited periods of time as long as specified alternative \nmeasures are  used while the operational aids are being repaired. By contrast, under  Sec.  1926.1412(f)(4), \nif any deficiency is identified in the annual  inspection, the qualified person must make an immediate \ndetermination  as to whether the deficiency constitutes a safety hazard. If it does,  under Sec.  \n1926.1412(f)(4), the equipment must be removed from service  immediately.

(ID-0144.1.) This commenter \nclaimed that the prohibition  would limit the ability of electric utility owners and operators to  provide \noperators-in-training with hands on training.

(ID-0343.) A representative from a steel \nerection company  agreed that certification is important to both insurance companies and  employers \nbecause certification gives employers peace of mind and  reduces insurance costs. (ID-0344.)     In light of \nthe need for clarification and witness support at the  hearing, OSHA is adding new paragraph (a)(4) to this \nsection of the  final rule. Paragraph (b) Option (1): Certification by an Accredited Crane Operator  Testing \nOrganization     As noted above, the proposed rule provided four options for a crane  operator to be \nqualified or certified. Option (1) of this section, in  which the employee becomes certified to operate \nequipment of a certain  type and capacity by passing an examination administered by an  accredited testing \norganization, is the most broadly available option,  and OSHA expects it to be the one that most employers \nuse outside of  jurisdictions with State or local licensing requirements.      Under O ption (1), a crane \noperator becomes certified by a testing  organization that has itself been accredited by a \"nationally  \nrecognized accrediting agency.\" Section 1926.1401 defines \"nationally  recognized accrediting agency\" as \"an \norganization that, due t o its  independence and expertise, is widely recognized as competent to  accredit \ntesting organizations.\" The use of a nationally recognized  accrediting agency to provide an independent, \nauthoritative assurance  of a testing organization's competence is a well-established practice.  For example, \nfor a number of years, the National Commission for  Certifying Agencies (NCCA), the accreditation body of the \nNational  Organization for Competency Assurance (NOCA), has accredited testing  organizations in a wide \nvariety of fields, including those that provide  crane operator certification. (ID -0021.) Also, in 2003, the \nAmerican  National Standards Institute began accrediting personnel certification  entities. (ID -0022.)     \nUnder Sec.  1926.1427(b)(1)(i), for a te sting organization to  become accredited, the accrediting agency must \ndetermine that the  testing organization's written testing materials, practical  examinations, test \nadministration, grading, facilities/equipment and  personnel meet industry recognized criteria. The \naccrediting agency  must determine that the written testing materials and practical  examinations are well \ndesigned and sufficiently comprehensive that an  individual who achieves a passing grade has demonstrated \nthe skills and  knowledge needed to operate the equipment safely. The accrediting  agency must also \ndetermine that the testing organization's  administration and grading ensure the integrity of the test so that \nthe  individual's grade truly represents the knowledge and skill level of  that individual.      A safety \nassociation believed that the criteria for accrediting  agencies in proposed Sec.  1926.1427(b)(1)(i) were not \nsufficiently  rigorous and suggested replacing that paragraph with a paragraph that  required the nationally \nrecognized accrediting agency to use  certification criteria equal to or greater than that of the National  \nCommission of Certifying Agencies (NCCA), the Council of Engineering  and Scientific Specialty Boards (CESB), \nor ANSI/ISO/IEC 17024, General  Requirements for Bodies Operating Certification Systems of Persons.  (ID-\n0178.1.) This commenter expressed concern that, without this more  specific level of rigor, entities with little \nexperience in  professional certification will be able to establish accrediting bodies  for certifications that do \nnot adequately demonstrate professional  crane operator competence.      An operator certification \norganization stated that NCCA and ANSI  are nationally recognized accrediting agencies and that others should  \nonly be designated as such by OSHA after a comprehensive review of its  accrediting protocols. (ID-0382.1.) It \nsuggested changing the  definition of \"nationally recognized accrediting  agency\" in Sec.   1926.1401 to \nspecify that the only accrediting agencies are ANSI, NCCA,  and any other organization designated by OSHA as \ncompetent to accredit  testing organizations.     These commenters are concerned that an organization \nthat applies  insufficiently stringent accrediting criteria might claim to be a  \"nationally recognized",

OSHA also notes that the \nexclusion  of digger derricks from the scope of this subpart for pole work should  largely alleviate this \ncommenter's concern. Accordingly, OSHA is  retaining paragraph (f)(5)(i) in the final rule.  Paragraph (g)     \nParagraph (g) of this section provides that \"a testing entity is  permitted to provide training as well as testing \nservices as long as  the criteria of the applicable accrediting agency (in the option  selected) for an \norganization providing both services are met.\" This  paragraph serves two purposes. First, it makes clear that \nan entity  providing qualification/certification testing may also provide training  to the individuals it tests, as \nwell as others. Second, it establishes  a condition such entities must satisfy: the testing agency must meet  \nthe criteria of its accrediting agency for an organization providing  both services.      For example, an \nindustry consensus standard, the International  Organization for Standardization (\"ISO\") 17024, requires that \na  certifying entity only offer training if it can demonstrate that the  training is independent of both \nevaluation and certification. This is  intended to prevent the entity's training arm from \"teaching to the  test,\" \nwhich would detract from the test's ability to determine the  individual's true knowledge of the subject matter \nneeded for safe  operation. It is also necessary to protect the integrity of the  testing. Therefore, with respect \nto those accrediting agencies that  apply the ISO standard, a testing entity may also conduct training as  long \nas an adequate \"firewall\" exists between the two functions.  Paragraph (h)     Paragraph (h) of this section \naddresses C-DAC's concern that some  competent crane operators may be hindered in obtaining qualification \nor  certification under this section because they have difficulty with  taking written tests even though they \npossess sufficient literacy for  reading and understanding safety -related mater ial such as the crane's  \noperating manual and load chart. To avoid disqualifying individuals  solely because they have this type of \ndifficulty, paragraph (h) permits  written tests under this section to be administered verbally, with  answers \ngiven verbally, where the operator candidate (1) passes a  written demonstration of literacy relevant to the \nwork; and (2)  demonstrates the ability to use the type of written manufacturer  procedures applicable to \nthe class/type of equipment for which the  candidate is seeking certification. These would typically include, \nfor  example, the load chart and operator's manual for the crane the  candidate would be operating. Thus, \nparagraph (h) only permits tests to  be administered verbally where the individual demonstrates the literacy  \nneeded to read and understand written material needed for safe  operation.     As explained in the \nproposed rule, neither of the demonstrations in  paragraphs (h)(1) or (h)(2) would have to be made in English \n(see 73 FR  59816, Oct. 9, 2008). As an example, under these provisions, an  employer could obtain a Spanish-\nlanguage version of the load charts and  operator's manual, and arrange to have the literacy test administered  \nin Spanish. An operator able to meet the requirements of Sec.   1926.1427(h) using these Spanish language \nmaterials would have  demonstrated adequate literacy under the rule.      A trade association supported \nthe provision allowin g examinations  to be administered verbally. (ID -0151.1.) A testing organization  \nopposed the provision, believing it adds an unnecessary and potentially  harmful step in the qualification \nprocess. (ID -0343.) The testing  organization was concerned that th e rule does not identify standards or  \nprotocols by which the written demonstration of literacy relevant to  the work and the ability to use written \nmanufacturer procedures are to  be made.      OSHA recognizes the testing organization's concern but \nconcludes  that the rule must allow sufficient flexibility in the testing process  to enable individuals who have \nsufficient literacy skills and are  demonstrably competent to operate a crane, but are deficient in written  \ntest-taking ability, to obtain qualifica tion/certification under this  rule. Accordingly, OSHA is retaining the \nprovision allowing tests to be  administered verbally if the specified demonstrations of literacy are  made.",

Most crane  operations will be \nnear typical residential power lines of less than 50  kV, with a minimum clearance distance from Table A of 10 \nfeet.      Hold a planning meeting which for the typical crane  operation will consist of the crane operator, \nspotter, and any on-site  employer or contractor (for a lattice-boom crane that truly performs A/ D operations, \nmany more individuals are involved in the planning  meeting as required in Sec.  1926.1407(b)(1);       \nEmploy a spotter to ensure that the minimum clearance  distance is maintained, and provide training for the \nspotter, if needed   (2 hours plus 15 minutes training).      The Agency estimates that the total costs of \nproviding protective  procedures during A/D near power lines for a typical crane job will  cost less than $100. \nTable B-9, Cost by Provision, shows that the total  costs of these operations for all affected employers is \nestimated to be  about $16 million annually.  Crane Operations Within 20 Feet of Power Lines (Sec.  \n1926.1408)     Under the pro posed standard, before beginning crane or derrick  operations, employers \nmust either: (1) Define a work zone with  demarcated boundaries by using flags or a device such as a range- \nlimiting device or range -control warning device that prohibits the  operator from operating the crane past \nthose boundaries, or (2) define  the work zone as the area 360 degrees around the crane based on the  \ncrane's maximum working radius (see proposed Sec.  1926.1408(a)(1)).  The Agency estimates that, in most \ncases, the least -cost option would  be to mark the zone with flags. Based on the defined work zone, the  \nemployer must determine whether the crane, load, or load line, if  operated to its maximum working radius, \ncould get closer than 20 feet  to a power line.     If the 20-foot determination is positive, then the employer \nwould  be required to follow one of three options. If any part of the crane,  load, or load line could not come \nwithin more than 20 feet of a power  line at the crane's maximum radius, the employer would not be required  \nto take any further action. If the crane operations could take the  crane closer than 20 feet, the employer must \neither: (1) De-energize  and visibly ground the power line, (2) maintain the 20-foot clearance  by employing \na spotter or other  warning device, after having a planning  meeting, or (3) determine the line voltage and \nminimum clearance  distance and maintain that distance between all crane parts and the  power line by \nemploying a spotter or other warning device, after having  a planning meeting.     If the employer follows \nOption (2) or (3), the employer must then  maintain the appropriate distance by implementing several \nencroachment- prevention procedures to ensure that the crane does not contact the  energized power lines, \nincluding: Having a planning meeting with the  operator and other workers who will be in the area of the crane, \nand  using either a proximity alarm, operational aid s/limiting devices, a  dedicated spotter, or an elevated \nwarning line. The Agency estimates  that a designated spotter would be used to ensure that the appropriate  \ndistance is maintained between the crane and power line.     In the SBAR panel process, many small entity \nrepresentatives  commented on this provision. The majority believed that, most of the  time, a dedicated \nspotter would be used.

The manner of transmission of the signal is  addressed separately. No \ncomments were received on this paragraph; it  is promulgated as proposed.     The criteria for the use of \nthese signal types are set ou t in  Sec. Sec.  1926.1419(c) -(m) (additional voice signal requirements are  in \nSec.  1926.1421, Signals --voice signals--additional requirements).  The Committee's intent was to reduce the \npotential for  miscommunication, which can lead to injuries and fatalities,  particularly from \"struck-by\" and \n\"crushed-by\" incidents. In  setting parameters for the use of the various types of existing signal  methods, \nand for signal methods that may be developed in the future,  the Committee sought to promote a degree of \nstandardization while still  allowing appropriate flexibility. In addition, the provisions are  designed to ensure \nthat the selection of signal type and means of  sending the signals are appropriate under the circumstances \nand  reliable. Paragraph (c) Hand Signals     Paragraph (c) of this section addresses the use of hand signals.  \nThe industry has long recognized the need for consistent, universal  hand signals to minimize the potential for \nmiscommunication between  signal persons and operators. ANSI B3 0.5-1968, \"Crawler, Locomotive  and \nTruck Cranes,\" contains illustrations of hand signals that are the  same as the current 2004 edition of ASME \nB30.5 and that are consistent  with hand signals for other types of cranes in ASME B30 standards. The  same \nhand signals have been expressed in similar charts published by a  variety of other groups. (See, e.g., \nConstruction Safety Association of  Ontario, MIOSHA, MSHA.)     Because of the industry's long familiarity \nwith these standard hand  signals, C -DAC determined that, when using hand signals, the  standardized \nversion of the signals should continue to be required.  These signals, which are located in Appendix A, are \nreferred to as the  \"Standard Method,\" and this term is defined in Sec.  1926.1401 as  \"the protocol in \nAppendix A for hand signals.\" However, the Committee  recognized that there are instances when use of the \nStandard Method is  either infeasible or where there is no Standard Method signal  applicable to the work \nbeing done.      In such instances, under this paragraph, non -standard signals may  be used. To avoid \nconfusion when non -standard signals are used,  proposed Sec.  1926.1419(c)(2) requires that the  signal \nperson, crane  operator, and lift director (where there is one) meet prior to the  operation to agree upon the \nsignals that will be used.      At the public hearing, one witness commented that the use of non - standard \nhand signals should not be allo wed because it would  unnecessarily confuse contractors and utility workers, \nand because  standard signals are already used in the industry. (ID-345.17.) OSHA  defers to the expertise of \nthe Committee, which found that a non- standard signal may be needed on occasion (see 73 FR 59797, Oct. 9,  \n2008, in which the Agency described examples of such situations).  Additionally, it should be noted that Sec.  \n1926.1419(c) requires the  use of Standard Method hand signals and permits an exception only where  the \nStandard Method signals are infeasible or where there is no  Standard Method signal for the particular \nattachment.     One commenter pointed out that there are currently no hand signals  specific to articulating \ncranes and asked which signals OSHA intended  to be used with articulating cranes. (ID -0206.1.) The record \ncontains  no information on the extent to which hand signals for articulating  cranes may differ from those \nused for other cranes. If the use of  Standard Method hand signals is either infeasible for articulating  cranes, \nor if the use or operation of an attachment is not covered by  the Standard Method, then the exception in Sec.  \n1926.1419(c)(1) and  the requirements for non-standard hand signals in Sec.  1926.1419(c)(2)  would apply.     \nOSHA is only making two changes, neither of which is substantive,  from Sec.  1926.1419(c) as proposed.",

U.S. Census Bureau data.   7. Economic \nFeasibility and Impacts     This section presents OSHA's analysis of the potential economic  impacts of the \nfinal standard and an assessment of its economic  feasibility. A separate analysis of the potential economic \nimpacts on  small entities (as defined by the Small Business Administration) and on  very small entities \n(employers with fewer than 20 employees) is  presented in the following section as part of the Final Regulatory  \nFlexibility Analysis, conducted in accordance with the Regulatory  Flexibility Act.      A standard is \neconomically feasible if it does not threaten massive  dislocation to an industry or imperil its existence. (See \nUnited  Steelworkers v. Marshall, 647 F.2d 1189 (DC Cit. 1980).) The court also  found that a standard that is \nfinancially burdensome or threatens the  survival of some companies in an industry is not sufficient to render  \nit infeasible. Further, the cost of compliance with an OSHA standard  must be analyzed \"in relation to the \nfinancial health and  profitability of the industry and the likely effect of such costs on  unit consumer prices.\" \nId. The court also found that \"the practical  question is whether the standard threatens the competitive \nstability of  an industry, or whether any intra-industry or inter-industry  discrimination in the standard might \nwreck such stability or lead to  undue concentration.\" Id.     To assess the potential economic impacts of \nthe final rule, OSHA  compared the anticipated costs of achieving compliance against revenues  and profits \nof establishments affected by the rule. This screening  analysis is presented in Table B -12. This table is \nconsidered a  screening analysis because it measures costs as a percent of pre-tax  profits and revenues, but \ndoes not predict impacts on pre -tax profits  and sales. This screening analysis is used to determine whether \nthe  compliance costs potentially associated with the standard would lead to  significant impacts on \nestablishments in the affected industries. The  actual impact of the standard on the profits and revenues of  \nestablishments in a given industry will depend on the price elasticity  of demand for the services sold by \nestablishments in that industry.     Price elasticity refers to the relationship between the price  charged for",

However, OSHA does not agree  that a distinction based on crane size is justified. \nWhen smaller  cranes operate near power lines, they present the same hazard as larger  cranes and need to \ntake similar precautions. OSHA further notes that  smaller cranes, i.e., cranes with shorter booms, will have a \nsmaller  work zone than larger cranes  and therefore should be better able to  avoid coming within the \npermitted 20-foot clearance and, as a result,  may be less likely to trigger the protective steps required under  \nparagraph (a)(2) of this section in any event. Moreover, if OSHA were  to adopt a 15-foot minimum clearance \ndistance for this option as  advocated by the commenter, it would have to make a corresponding  reduction \nin the maximum voltage covered by Sec. Sec.  1926.1407 and  1926.1408 and a corresponding increase in \nthe minimum volta ge covered  by Sec.  1926.1409 to retain the protection afforded by the 10 -foot  rule \npreviously contained in subpart N. Therefore, OSHA has concluded  that it would be inappropriate to decrease \nthe proposed 20 foot minimum  clearance distance under Sec.  1926.1408(a)(2)(ii); this paragraph is  \ntherefore promulgated as proposed.     As noted above, in addition to maintaining a minimum clearance  \ndistance of 20 feet, employers using this option are required to  implement the encroachment prevention and \nother measures specified in  Sec.  1926.1408(b).  Paragraph (a)(2)(iii) Option (3)     Under Option (3) (Sec.  \n1926.1408(a)(2)(iii)), the employer is  required to maintain a minimum clearance distance \\44\\ in accordance  \nwith Table A of this section. \\45\\ Under Table A, depending on the voltage of  the power line, the minimum \nclearance distance ranges from 10 feet to  20 feet. \\46\\ Under this option the employer is required to \ndetermine  the line's voltage.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\44\\ The \nproposed regulatory text for this section used the  phrase \"minimum approach distance\" instead of \"minimum \nclearance  distance.\" As pointed out by two commenters the latter phrase is  what was used in the proposed \nSec.  1926.1407(a)(3)(i) regulatory  text. (ID-0205.1; -0213.1.) For consistency, OSHA has, in this  section, \nchanged the phrase \"minimum approach distance\" to  \"minimum clearance distance.\" Provisions in Sec .  \n1910.269 and  proposed subpart V of 29 CFR 1926 use the phrase \"minimum approach  distance.\" OSHA \nbelieves that employers who are covered by those  standards are familiar with that term. In contrast, the \nAgency  believes that employers that do not perform electric power work will  better understand the term \n\"minimum clearance distances.\" OSHA  considers the terms \"approach distance\" and \"clearance distance\"  \nto be interchangeable; no substantive distinctions are intended.      \\45\\ The information in Table A of the \nfinal rule is similar to  information in Table 1 of ASME B30.5-2004. A table with specified  clearance distances \nis more easily applied than the formula set out  in former Sec.  1926.550(a)(15). Table A is intended to be a \nclear  way of conveying the minimum clearance distances.     \\46\\ The range referred to here is the range \nin the part of the  table that is applicable up to 350 kV. -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n----      In addition to maintaining the minimum clearance distance specified  in the Table, employers using \nthis option are required to implement the  encroachment prevention and other measures specified in Sec.   \n1926.1408(b).     A labor representative urged OSHA to require a minimum clearance  distance of 20 feet \nrather than the lower clearance distances allowed  under Table A, in essence eliminating Option (3). (ID -\n0201.1.) The 20 - foot clearance is needed because, in the com menter's view, under the  options in the \nproposal, crane operations can easily encroach on an  absolute safe distance from power lines. OSHA does \nnot agree.",

The Agency received several \nestimates of the cost of operator  certification as part of the Small Business Advocacy Review Panel  (SBAR). \nJohn Anderson reported that he estimated certification costs at  $2,900 per employee, including five days for \ntraining, exam, and wages  (OSHA-S030A-2006-0064-0019), with the average cost of an exam $382 and  with \ntraining or prep courses $1,260 on average, and wages $1,255. Mr.  Anderson also cited a general contractor's \ncost of exams and prep class  of $1,375. Art Daniels of AR Daniels Construction estimated the cost of  \ncertifying one operator to be $6,141.59, but did not provide any detail  of how the estimate was determined. \nMr. Daniel also commented that the  Agency's wage estimate was too low, but his estimate included wages",

OSHA  concludes that prudence \ndictates amending this provision to require  that the selected measure be effective in preventing \nencroachment; the  final rule therefore reflects the change described above.      In situations where an \nemployer chooses t he option of using a  dedicated spotter to prevent encroachment under Sec.  \n1926.1407(b)(3),  the employer is required to meet the requirements for spotters in Sec.   1926.1407(b)(3)(i). \nAs specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this  section, the spotter must be equipped with a visual aid to assist \nin  identifying the minimum clearance distance. The Committee concluded  that a visual aid is needed for \nthe spotter because of the difficulty  in visualizing the minimum clearance distance boundary in the air.      \nUnder paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(B)-(D) of this section, the spotter must  be positioned so that he/she can effectively \ngauge the clearance  distance from the power line; the spotter, where necessary, must use  equipment that \nenables him/her to communicate d irectly with the  equipment operator; and the spotter must give timely \ninformation to the  operator so that the required clearance distance can be maintained. C- DAC determined \nthat each criterion is needed for the spotter to be able  to be effective.     One commenter on this provision \nasked whether an airhorn is  appropriate communication equipment for purposes of paragraph (C). (ID- 0120.) \nOSHA determines that an airhorn would not enable the dedicated  spotter to communicate with the operator \nas effectively as a radio,  telephone, or other electronic communication device, and, in any event,  might not \nbe an effective means of communication on a noisy  construction site; therefore, OSHA does not consider use \nof an airhorn  to constitute compliance with paragraph (C).\\36\\ -----------------------------------------------------------\n----------------      \\36\\ The cross -reference to Sec.  1926.1420 originally included  in this provision as \nproposed was deleted in the final rule for  consistency with the parallel provisions for dedicated spotters in  \nSec. Sec.  1926.1408(b)(4)(ii)(C) and 1926.1410(d)(2)(iii). This is  a ministerial change not intended to have \nany substantive  enforcement implications.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  \nParagraph (c) Assembly/Disassembly Below Power Lines Prohibited     This paragraph precludes employers \nfrom assembling or disassembling  cranes/derricks beneath energized power lines. The Agency agreed with  \nthe Committee's conclusion that assembly/disassembly below energized  power lines presents an extreme \nrisk and needs to be prohibited. The  assembly/disassembly process necessarily involves moving and hoisting  \nparts of the equipment into place. If some of this work takes place  beneath a power line, the risk that a part, \nload, load line, or other  equipment would make electrical contact is very high. Also, in both  assembly and \ndisassembly, maneuvering an assembled crane out from under  the power lines, or maneuvering a crane that \nis about to be  disassembled under them, itself poses a high risk of such contact.     C-DAC's agreement on \nthis provision indicates a determination by  the Committee that, in almost all cases, the employer can plan \nthe  assembly/disassembly so that there will be no need to be beneath power  lines. The Committee and \nOSHA also concluded that, in the very few  instances where this is not possible, in light of the extreme risk  \ninvolved, it is essential that the lines be deenergized a nd visibly  grounded. No comments were received on \nthis provision; it is  promulgated as proposed.  Paragraph (d) Assembly/Disassembly Closer Than Table A \nClearance  Prohibited     Assembly and disassembly of cranes/derricks closer than the minimum  \nclearance distance in proposed Table A of Sec.  1926.1408 to an  energized power line is prohibited under \nthis paragraph. If assembly or  disassembly needs to take place closer than that distance, the employer  is \nrequired to have the line deenergized and visibly grounded. The  rationale for this provision is similar to that \ndiscussed above for  assembly/disassembly beneath power lines (that rationale is set forth  in the discussion \nin the proposed rule preamble of proposed Sec.",

OSHA                                            then concluded that the                                            \ncomments also were not                                            persuasive as to why operators                                           \nof smaller capacity equipment                                           should be allowed limited",

The Agency also received considerable new information about ge neral  industry sectors that \nwould be affected by the final standard. The  Agency has incorporated that information into its estimates of \ncosts  for those sectors. The Agency has also updated its information about  wages, establishments, and \nrevenues from the 2006 Statistics for U.S.  Business (SUSB) and County Business Patterns. As the number of \ncranes  in the PEA was, for some sectors, based on an estimate of revenues, the  number of cranes for some \nsectors has changed from the PEA based on  newer revenue data.     Employers have four years from the \npublication date of the final  rule to comply with the requirements for operator certification. The  Agency \ncould assess that cost across the next four years and discount  those values back to the present to add to the \nother annual costs of  the standard. However, assessing benefits for only part of the final  standard for \nseveral years is problematic. The Agency has concluded  that the clearest picture of cost, benefits, and impacts \nwill be given  as if all costs and benefits of the final standard occur in the first  year. This removes the \nproblems of parsing risk reduction from separate  provisions of the final standard for several years, in addition \nto  assessing when employers might comply with certification and the  resulting effects on discounting. \nPresenting full benefits and costs  side by side also provides the easiest view of the long -run effects of  the \nfinal standard.     The Agency presents and discusses comment on the PEA, new  information in the record, \nand revisions to cost estimates in the  following sections: operator certification, power lines, assembly/  \ndisassembly (A/D), inspections, and ground conditions. Unit costs are  explained below and presented in Table \nB-8. Wage rates in the PEA were  based on 2003 BLS data. The Agency has increased these base wage rates  \nby 19 percent for the FEA, based on more recent BLS data. Summarized  costs by provision are presented in \nTable B-9. Cost of Operator Certification     For the FEA, the Agency has increased the estimated cost of test  \npreparation (a course) for a third party operator exam from $500 in the  PEA to $1,500, plus, as before, $250 \nfor the exam itself and 18 hours  of wages ($31.37/hour, total of $564). When the total initial cost  ($2,064) \nis annualized over 5 years, the annualized amount is about  $500. In addition, based on comment in the record \nthe Agency has  increased the baseline of current compliance in the traditional  construction industries from \n30 percent to 60 percent, and assumed that  no crane operators in the affected general industry sectors have \nbeen  certified (ID-0341; -0342; -0343; -0344). The Agency also reduced the  turnover rate of crane operators \nfrom 23 percent to 5 percent, thus  reducing the number of new entrants each year who would require  \ncertification. The annualized cost of crane operator certification is  estimated to be about $59 million per year .     \nThe PEA had estimated that a two-day preparation and testing would  cost employers $750 for each employee \ntaking the operators  certification test ($500 for the prep cou rse, and $250 for the written  and practical \nexam). In addition, employers would have to pay the wages  of a crane operator ($31.37 per hour with benefits) \nfor 16 hours of his  time, plus an additional 2 hours, on average, for travel. The total  cost was estimated to \nbe $1,314 per employee taking the crane  certification exam. The Agency annualized that one-time figure over \n10  years, for an annual per operator costs of $187.     The Agency erred in the PEA in annualizing the cost \nof the training  and testing over 10 years instead of five, since the certification is  only good for five years.",

OSHA concludes that the use of \"category\" \nin the  ASTM standard would cause considerable confusion if OSHA were to  incorporate the ASTM \ndefinitions directly. Accordingly, OSHA is  promulgating proposed paragraph (c)(1) as paragraph (e)(1) of the \nfinal  rule. Paragraph (e)(2)     Paragraphs (e)(2) of this section sets forth use requirements of  the three \ntypes of rotation resistant rope in terms of operating design  factors (and in some instances activity). The \npurpose of these  provisions is to ensure that the selection of the type of rotation  resistant rope is suitable, \nin terms of safety, to its use.      These requirements are identical to those in proposed paragrap h  (c)(2). \nThe preamble to the proposed rule explained in detail the basis  for setting these design factors for rotation \nresistant rope (see 73 FR  59782-59783, Oct. 9, 2008). One commenter, stated that rotation  resistant ropes \nshould have a design factor of less than 5 only for  single engineered lifts, but provided no rationale for this \nposition.  No other comments addressed the proposed design factors, and OSHA is  deferring to the",

(ID -0137.1.) This commenter said  that such a requirement is \nappropriate because climbing frames are  often hoisted or lowered by the crane while workers are on them. \nOSHA  is aware of no reason why workers need to be on a climbing frame while  it is being hoisted and it \nnotes that such a practice would violate a  number of provisions of Sec.  1926.1431. A s discussed in Sec.   \n1926.1431, cranes are designed to hoist material, not personnel, and  may only be used to hoist personnel \nwhen stringent requirements to  ensure safety are followed, including the requirement that the lift not  \nexceed 50% of the equipment's rated capacity. OSHA is not requiring  that all rigging used in climbing a tower \ncrane meet this requirement  because it does not determine that workers should be, or commonly are,  \nhoisted while on the climbing frame.      The same commenter stated that the swing should be disabled \nduring  climbing and that a pre-test of the hydraulic system should be  performed when the upper structure \nis initially raised. This commenter  did not offer any rationale in support of these suggestions, and OSHA  \ndoes no t conclude they are needed to ensure the safety of the climbing  process.     Section \n1926.1435(b)(8), Counterweight/ballast, addresses the  hazard of instability that can result from improper \ninstallation or  removal of counterweight/ballast, which can ca use a collapse. Sections  1926.1435(b)(8)(i) \nand (ii) require that tower cranes not be erected,  dismantled or operated without the amount and position \nof counterweight  or ballast in place as specified by the manufacturer or a registered  professional engineer \nfamiliar with the equipment and that the maximum  amount of counterweight or ballast not be exceeded. No \ncomments  addressed this paragraph, and it is promulgated as proposed.  Paragraph (c) Signs      Section \n1926.1435(c) requires employers to comply with the  manufacturer's specifications regarding the size and \nlocation of signs.  This requirement addresses the hazards that can result from attaching  signs (such as signs \nwith the company's name) to tower cranes. The  force of the wind bearing against a large sign can significantly  \nincrease the horizontal force the wind exerts on the crane. According  to the Committee, most manufacturers \nspecify the maximum size and  permissible location of signs so that the stability of the tower crane  is not \ncompromised. Where the manufacturer does not specify this  information or where such information is \nunavailable, this provision  requires a registered professional engineer who is familiar with the  specific type \nof tower crane involved to give written approval of the  size and location of any signs. The provision applies \nirrespective of  whether the sign was installed during or after erecting/climbing. No  comments were \nreceived on this provision, and it is promulgated as  proposed. Paragraphs (d) Safety Devices and (e) \nOperational Aids     These paragraphs set out the safety devices and operational aids  that are required on \ntower cranes. Sections 1926.1415 and 1926.1416,  which require safety devices and operational aids on other \ntypes of  cranes, are not applicable to tower cranes. Instead, Sec. Sec.   1926.1435(d) and (e) apply. Although \nsome of the safety devices and  operational aids for tower cranes are the same as those that Sec. Sec.   \n1926.1415 and 1926.1416 require for other equipment, others are unique  to tower cranes. C -DAC \ndetermined it would promote clarity to list all  the devices and aids for tower cranes in this section.      \nSafety devices must be in proper working order. Where a safety  device is not in proper working order, the \ncrane must be taken out of  service until it is again functioning properly. The Committee  determined that \nthe protection offered by safety devices is critical to  safe operation and that there is no alternative way to \nachieve the same  level of safety that the safety devices provide. By contrast, if an  operational aid is \nmalfunctioning, operations may continue where the  employer implements specified temporary alternative \nmeasures. Where the  tower crane manufacturer specifies more protective alternative measures  than those",

Therefore, OSHA has \nfinalized                                           this provision as it was                                            \nproposed. The Panel recommends that OSHA solicit   In the discussion of proposed   public comment on \nmaking it clear        Sec.   1926.1427(h)(1), OSHA   that: (1) an employer is permitted to    requested \npublic comment on  equip its cranes with manuals re-        this issue. Based on the  written in a way that \nwould allow an     analysis of the comments   operator with a low literacy level to    received, OSHA \nconcludes that  understand the material (such as         these manuals may not be re -  substituting some \ntext with pictures     written as recommended because   and illustrations), and (2) making it    it could \ncause information  clear that, when the cranes are          important for safety to be   equipped with \nsuch re-written manuals    omitted.   and materials, the \"manuals\" and   \"materials\" referred to in these   \nliteracy provisions would be the re-  written manuals. The Panel recommends that OSHA explain   OSHA will \nissue a Small   in a Small Business Compliance Guide     Business Compliance Guide   that the \ncertification/qualification     after the final rule is   test does not need to be administered    issued, and \nwill explain these   in English but can be administered in    points in the Guide.   a language that the \ncandidate can  read; and that while the employee  would also need to have a sufficient  level of literacy to \nread and   understand the relev ant information in   the equipment manual, that requirement   would be \nsatisfied if the material is  written in a language that the  employee can read and understand. ------------------\n------------------------------------------------------  IV. Summary and E xplanation of the Rule   Authority Citations       \nFor all subparts affected by this rulemaking, the authority  citations have been amended to refer to the \ndocumentation that permits  the promulgation of this rule.  Removal of Sec.  1926.31 and Addition of Sec.  \n1926.6--Incorporation by  Reference      Section 1926.31 of 29 CFR part 1926 provided information about  \nlocating documents incorporated by reference into all of the  construction standards in that part. The Agency \nis removing this  section and relocating the majority of its text to new 29 CFR 1926.6  for several reasons. \nFirst, the change in the location of the section  from Sec.  1926.31 to Sec.  1926.6 is for organizational \npurposes. New  Sec.  1926.6 is wit hin 29 CFR part 1926 subpart A (\"General\"), which  is a more logical \nplacement than Sec.  1926.31, which is within subpart  C (\"General Safety and Health Provisions\"), and is the \nsame section  number (6) as the incorporation reference section for general i ndustry  standards: 29 CFR \n1910.6. Second, OSHA is relocating the list of all  documents incorporated by reference into 29 CFR part 1926 \nfrom its  previous location in the \"Finding Aids\" of the CFR to Sec.  1926.6  because the Federal Register is \nno longer publishing the list in the  hardcopy versions of the CFR.\\2\\ -----------------------------------------------------\n----------------------      \\2\\ The list will still be available online at http://www.gpoaccess.gov/ecfr  from the \nlink to \"Incorporated by R eference.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      The",

Sec.  \n1926.1413(a)(3)(iv) and  (a)(3)(v) to read the same as proposed Sec. Sec.   1926.1413(c)(2)(ii)(C) and (F) \n(\"Wire rope in c ontact with saddles,  equalizer sheaves or other sheaves where rope travel is limited\" and  \n\"Wire rope at or near terminal ends\"). Section 1926.1413(c)(2)(ii)(A)  now incorporates by reference the \ncritical review items listed in  Sec. Sec.  1926.1413(a)(3) (iv) and (a)(3)(v), thereby making the items  listed \nin Sec. Sec.  1926.1413(c)(2)(ii)(C) and (c)(2)(ii)(F)  redundant.     Two commenters supported keeping \nparagraphs (c)(2)(ii)(C) and (F),  even though they are also included in paragraph (a)(3) of this section,  saying \nthat annual inspections are more comprehensive and, in their  view, should be treated separately. (ID-0205.1; \n-0213.1.) However, the  modification made by OSHA does not change the proposed requirements for  annual \ninspections; it only avoids redundant language. Accordingly,  OSHA is deleting proposed Sec. Sec.  \n1926.1413(c)(2)(ii)(C) and (F)  from the final rule and is renumbering proposed paragraphs (D) and (E)  to (C) \nand (D).      Proposed paragraph (c)(2)(iii) established an exception to the  timing of the \nannual/comprehensive inspection where that inspection is  infeasible due to \"existing set -up and \nconfiguration of the equipment  (such as where an assist crane is needed) or due to site conditions  (such as \na dense urban setting).\" The provision sets a timetable for  annual/comprehensive inspections in such cases \nthat requires the  inspection to be perfor med \"as soon as it becomes feasible, but no  longer than an \nadditional 6 months for running ropes and, for standing  ropes, at the time of disassembly.\" The provision \nreflects C-DAC's  concern that, particularly in densely developed urban settings, the  inability to boom down \nwould prevent the employer from completing a  comprehensive wire rope inspection.     Two commenters \nobjected to the length of the six -month period and  suggested it be reduced to one month. (ID -0122.0; -\n0178.1.) Neither  commenter provided any evidence of explanation to support its  recommendation, so \nOSHA is deferring to C-DAC's collective judgment and  is retaining the six-month period in the proposed rule.     \nProposed paragraph (c)(3) listed the next steps to be taken once  the qua lified person performing the \nannual/comprehensive inspection  discovers a deficiency. The qualified person must immediately determine  \nwhether the deficiency constitutes a safety hazard. If it does, under  proposed paragraph (c)(3)(i), the rope \nwould either have to be replaced  or, if the deficiency is localized, the damaged part may be severed and  the \nundamaged portion may continue to be used. As with paragraph  (a)(4)(i)(B), joining lengths of wire rope by \nsplicing would be  prohibited.     As discussed under paragraph (b)(3), a commenter recommended that  \nthe requirement of paragraph (c)(3)(ii) should be explicitly referenced  in the monthly inspection reports, and \nOSHA has made an addition to  paragraph (b)(3) to accomplish this. (ID -0226.) Also, as discussed  under \nparagraph (a)(4)(i)(B), OSHA is adding a requirement to paragraph  (c)(3)(i)(B) that at least two full wraps of \nwire rope must remain on  the drum when the load and/or boom is in its lowest position.      Paragraph \n(c)(4) requires the annual/comprehensive inspection to be  documented according to Sec.",

Paragraph (d) lists the required Category I operational \naids and  the acceptable temporary alternative measures for these aids.      Boom Hoist Limiting Device: \nParagraph (d)(1) requires that all  equipment manufactured after December 16, 1969, have a boom hoist  \nlimiting device. As defined in Sec.  1 926.1401, a boom hoist limiting  device \"disengages boom hoist power \nwhen the boom reaches a  predetermined operating angle\" and also \"sets brakes or closes valves  to prevent \nthe boom from lowering after power is disengaged.\" Section  1926.1401 also defines the term \"boom hoist \nlimiting device\" to  include \"boom hoist disengaging device, boom hoist shutoff, boom hoist  disconnect, \nboom hoist hydraulic relief, boom hoist kick-outs,  automatic boom stop device, or derricking limiter.\" A boom \nhoist  limiting device automatically prevents the boom hoist from pulling the  boom past the minimum \nallowable radius (maximum boom angle). If the  boom hoist pulls the boom past that point, a failure is likely \n(for  example, the boom could buckle from being forced against the boom stop).     The December 16, 1969, \ndate reflects the effective date of ASME  B30.5-1968. This was the first national consensus standard to require \na  boom hoist limiting device, and C-DAC regarded that date as a  reasonable indicator of when the industry \nbegan to widely manufacture  or equip cranes and derricks with such devices. OSHA agrees. Although  the \nASME standard only applies to crawler, locomotive, and truck  cranes, OSHA is extending this provision to all \nequipment based on  prevailing industry practice.     The standard includes three temporary alternative \nmeasures in  paragraphs (d)(1)(A)-(C), of which the employer must use at least one  if the boom hoist limiting \ndevice malfunctions: (A) Use of a boom angle  indicator; (B) clearly marking the boom hoist cable at a point \nthat  will give the operator sufficient time to stop the hoist to keep the  boom within the minimum allowable \nradius; and, (C) if a spotter is  used, clearly marking the boom hoist cable at a point that will give  the spotter \nsufficient time to signal the operator and have the  operator stop the hoist to keep the boom within the \nminimum allowable  radius. C-DAC recommended these measures because historically they were  used by \nemployers prior to the development of the boom hoist limiting  device.     In the proposed rule, Sec.  \n1926.1416(d)(1)(ii) specified that  employers must, on a permanent basis, use at least one of these  \nmeasures for equipment manufactured on or before December 16, 1969 that  \"was not originally equipped\" \nwith a boom hoist limiting device. OSHA  notes that equipment not originally equipped wi th a boom hoist \nlimiting  device might have one added later, and that such a piece of equipment  should be treated the same \nas equipment originally equipped with such a  device. Accordingly, OSHA has modified Sec.  \n1926.1416(d)(1)(ii) by  replacing \"was not originally equipped\" with \"is not equipped\" and  removing \"on a \npermanent basis.\" If and when the equipment is  modified to include the limiting device, it would fall under \nSec.   1926.1416(d)(1)(i). Until that point, it would remain under Sec.   1926.1416(d)(1)(ii), and at least one \nof the measures in paragraphs  (d)(1)(A)-(C) would be required at all times.      Luffing Jib Limiting Device: \nParagraph (d)(2) requires that  equipment with a luffing jib have a luffing jib limiting device. As  defined in \nSec.  1926.1401, a luffing jib limiting device \"is similar  to a boom hoist limiting device, except that it limits \nthe movement of  the luffing jib.\" These devices function similarly and are  distinguished only as to the type \nof crane extension they are designed  to limit automatically, the jib or the boom.",

In the final rule, OSHA has replaced  the phrase \n\"removed from service\" with \"taken out of service,\" which is the  phrase used in Sec.  1926.1417(f), to avoid \nany ambiguity about the  employer's duty to tag out the unsafe equipment . Paragraph (e) Monthly      \nParagraph (e) of this section requires a monthly inspection of the  equipment, the second of the three \nregularly scheduled general  inspections that are required by this standard. The monthly inspection  is \nidentical in coverage and manner to the shift inspection required by  Sec.  1926.1412(d), with one addition \ndiscussed below. Thus, the  monthly inspection is a visual inspection of the items listed in the  shift \ninspection for apparent deficiencies, conducted by a competent  person. However, unlike a shift inspection, \nthe employer must document  the inspection and retain the documentation for a minimum of three  months.     \nIn addition, under the annual/comprehensive inspection in Sec.   1926.1412(f)(4), the employer is required \nto identify developing  deficiencies that, while not yet safety hazards, need to be monitored.  In such cases \nthe employer, under Sec. Sec.  1926.1412(f)(4) and  (f)(6), is required to monitor them in the monthly \ninspections.     One commenter suggested  adding text to the final rule to clarify  how the monitoring \ninformation would be transferred from annual  inspector to monthly inspector, if different. (ID -0226.) The \nAgency is  not modifying the text of the rule as requested, but notes that under  paragraph (f)(7)(i) of this \nsection the inspector must document all  \"items checked and the results of the inspection.\" Therefore, if the  \ninspector determines that further monitoring is required, that  information would be a \"result of the \ninspection\" included in the  annual report. The inspector would then be responsible for checking the  annual \nreport prior to monthly inspections (see Sec.  1926.1412(f)(6).)     An industrial contractor commented that \nOSHA should require  employers to keep monthly inspection documentation for a minimum of  three months \nor the duration of the project, whichever is longer. (ID- 0120.) This commenter did not, however, describe how \nexpanding the  retention requirement would produce any significant benefit, and OSHA  determines there \nwould be no benefit. The documentation requirement  enables the individuals who use the equipment and \nconduct shift and  monthly inspections to assess the results of earlier monthly  inspections. Once more than \nthree months have passed since a monthly  inspection, the information in the documentation for that \ninspection  will not reflect the current condition of the equipment.      The SBREFA Panel recommended \nthat OSHA solicit public comment on  whether the provision for monthly inspections should, like that for  \nannual inspections, specify who must keep the documentation associated  with monthly inspections. (The \nprovision for annual inspections states  that the documentation must be \"maintained by the employer who  \nconducts the inspection.\") OSHA requested public comment on the issue  raised by the Panel's \nrecommendation. Several commenters believed that  OSHA should require th e employer who conducts the \nmonthly inspection to  maintain the documentation. (ID-0205; -0213; -0214; -0226.)     OSHA agrees that \nthe employer who conducts the monthly inspection  should maintain the documentation. This revision \nclarifies the intent  of C-DAC and is consistent with other provisions in this section.      A utility company \ncommented that if the operating employer is not  the inspecting employer, the operating employer should be \nprovided with  a copy of the inspection if requested. (ID-0226.) This comment suggests  that some employers \nwho operate rented equipment are concerned that the  required documentation may not be available to them \nfrom other parties  unless explicitly required in the regulatory text of this final rule.  In some cases, o ne \nemployer owns and operates the equipment used to  perform construction activities. It is reasonable to \nrequire these  employers to maintain the equipment inspection records. However, during  the analysis of",

The  \nrevision of Sec.  1926.600(a) (6) does not alter any of the substantive  requirements of that section, does not \nchange any existing rights or  obligations, and no member of the regulated community is likely to  object to \nit. OSHA, therefore, finds good cause that the opportunity  for public comment is unnecessary within the \nmeaning of 5 U.S.C.  533(b)(3)(B), 29 U.S.C. 655(b), and 29 CFR 1911.5.

That has since been  \nsuperseded by a 2005 edition. OSHA notes that, in all material  respects, the 2001 and 2005 versions of the \nprovisions listed in Sec.   1926.1438(b)(2)(iii) are the same. Except for sec. 2 -1.8.2, the 2001  and 2005 \nprovisions are identical.     Section 2-1.8.2 contains a wording change that does not  substantively alter that \nprovision. The 2001 version of sec. 2 -1.8.2  contains the following requirement, among others, for bridge \nbumpers:  \"energy-absorbing (or [dash]dissipating) capacity to stop the bridge  when traveling with power \noff in either direction at a speed of at  least 40% of rated load speed.\" In the 2005 version \"(or  \n[dash]dissipating)\" is changed to \"(or energy -dissipating).\" This is  clearly a clarification rather than a \nsubstantive change. Accordingly,  OSHA has changed Sec.  1926.1438(b)(2)(iii) to refer to the 2005  version \nof ASME B30.2.      When employers engaged in construction work must lock or tag  components of \noverhead and gantry cranes during maintenance and repair  work, Sec.  1926.1438(b)(2)(iii) requires them \nto comply with OSHA's  general industry lockout/tagout standard at Sec.  1910.147 instead of  the ANSI \nlockout/tagout standard (ANSI Z244.1) referenced in sec. 2 - 3.5.1(b) of ASME B30.2 -2005. The Committee \ndetermined that the OSHA  general industry lockout/tagout standard would be more accessible and  familiar \nto employers in the construction industry than the ANSI  standard. Therefore, requiring compliance with the \nOSHA standard will  promote compliance and, as a result, improve worker protection.     One commenter \nsuggested exempting all overhead and gantry cranes  from the scope of subpart CC because they are rarely \nused in construction.  (ID-0178.1.) While OSHA understands they are rarely used in construction,  these \ncranes are at least occasionally used in construction. Were the  Agency to delete this section entirely, these \ncranes (overhead and gantry  cranes used in construction) would not be explicitly covered by any  OSHA \nstandard.     The same commenter reasoned that, because overhead cranes are  primarily used in general \nindustry and S ec.  1910.179 does not require  operator certification, an overhead crane operator who \nperforms  construction work only occasionally would need to be certified for the  occasional construction-\nrelated pick, but not for any other part of the  job. As explai ned above, the rule distinguishes between \npermanently  installed overhead and gantry cranes, which are primarily used in  general industry, and those \nthat are not permanently installed, which  are primarily used in construction work.      The Committee \ndetermined that applying the general industry  standard (Sec.  1910.179) to overhead and gantry cranes that \nare  permanently installed in a facility and used for construction would  reduce compliance burdens without \njeopardizing employee protection.  However, the use of overhead and gantry cranes that are not permanently  \ninstalled in a facility, which are more frequently used fo r  construction, presents concerns about employee \nsafety that are  particular to the construction environment. For these overhead and  gantry cranes, the \nCommittee applied the safety requirements in Sec.   1910.179, which apply whether the crane is used in  \ngeneral industry or  construction, along with portions of subpart CC to address the specific  concerns about \ncranes used in construction. OSHA agrees.     The commenter recognized the Committee's concern when he \nstated  that, unlike operators of rented or subcontracted mobile cranes,  employers that deal with overhead \ncranes are very aware of the  qualifications of their operators.

Several commenters recommended that additional training be  \nrequired. (ID-0126.1; -0156.1;-0182.1; -0209.1.) One suggested that  maintenance and repair personnel be \ncertified by either the  manufacturer or an independent third party that they are trained in the  maintenance \nand repair of the crane. (ID-0156.1.) However, under Sec.   1926.1429(b), maintenance and repair employees \nare required to be  qualified persons. Those employees must be trained on the requirements  of subpart CC \nas required by Sec.  1926.1430(d) and must have the  education or experience to be considered a qualified \nperson as defined  in Sec.  1926.1401. This commenter has not presented evidence showing  that \nmanufacturer or third party certification would significantly  improve the qualifications of maintenance and \nrepair personnel who meet  the test of \"qualified person.\"      Another commenter felt additional hazard \nawareness training should  be required for employees. (ID -0182.1.) OSHA determines that the  training \nrequirements of this and other sections of subpart CC, along  with Sec.  1926.21 , provide for adequate \ntraining of all employees and  allow employers flexibility to provide training as needed for each  employee \nat various worksites.     Proposed Sec.  1926.1430(a), Overhead powerlines, stated that  employees listed \nin Sec.  1926.1408( g) must be trained accordance with  the requirements of that paragraph. As discussed in \nSec.  1926.1410,  OSHA has added Sec.  1926.1410(m), which requires that operators and  crew assigned \nto work with equipment that comes closer to power lines  than the minimum clearance distance permitted \nunder Sec. Sec.   1926.1408 and 1926.1409, must also be trained in accordance with Sec.   1926.1408(g). \nTo accommodate this change, Sec.  1926.1430(a) also  includes a reference to Sec.  1926.1410(m).      \nUnder paragraph (b) of this section, Signal persons, employees  assigned to work as signal persons and need \ntraining to meet the  requirements of Sec.  1926.1428(c) must be trained in the areas  addressed in that \nparagraph. As discussed in Sec.  1926.1428(c), each  employee who serves as a signal person must pass a \nverbal or written  test, and a practical test demonstrating the required knowledge and  skills. One \ncommenter believes the training requirement outlined in  this paragraph could be interpreted to mean that \nonly training is  required and the qualification requirements of Sec.  1926.1428 are not  applicable. (ID-\n0292.1.) This is incorrect. This paragraph requires an  employer to ensure the employee assigned as a signal \nperson receives  training, or re-training if needed, to be a signal person according to  Sec.  1926.1428. This \nis not a replacement for the qualification  requirements of Sec.  1926.1428. This provision is promulgated as  \nproposed except for the clarification of the employer's duty to train  each employee.      Proposed \nparagraph (c) of this section was entitled Operators, and  set forth training requirements for operators of \nequipment covered by  this subpart. Proposed Sec.  1 926.1430(c)(1) stated that \"operators  who are not \nqualified or certified under Sec.  1926.1427 shall be  trained in the areas addressed in Sec.  1926.1427(j). * \n* *\"     Several commenters believed that the language of proposed Sec.   1926.1430(c)(1) indicated that \noperators who have not been qualified or  certified under Sec.  1926.1427 may nonetheless operate cranes. \n(ID- 0156.1; -0182.1; -0208.1; -0292.1.) One commenter noted it could be  interpreted to mean that \ncertification was not required, only tra ining.  (ID-0182.1.)     Such interpretations are contrary to the \nAgency's intent.

OSHA received no  comment on this provision or definition. Therefore, \nOSHA is  promulgating paragraph (a)(2) as proposed.      Jib Stops: Section 1926.1415(a)(3) requires jib \nstops on all  equipment where a jib is attached, except for derricks (see the  discussion of this provision in 73 \nFR 59785, Oct. 9, 2008). The  standard defines \"Jib stop (al so referred to as a jib backstop)\" in  Sec.  \n1926.1401 as the \"same type of device as a boom stop but used  for a fixed or luffing jib.\" OSHA received no \ncomment on this  provision or definition. Therefore, OSHA is promulgating paragraph  (a)(3) as propose d.     \nFoot Pedal Brake Locks: Proposed paragraph (a)(4) required that  equipment with foot pedal brakes have locks, \nexcept for portal cranes  and floating cranes. Such locks prevent the unintentional disengagement  of a foot \npedal brake, which could lead to unintended equipment  movement and consequent injuries and fatalities. \nDue to the physical  effort needed to keep the pedal engaged, this is particularly important  where the brake \nis applied for long periods.      The rationale for exempting portal cranes and floating cranes from  this \nrequirement discussed by C-DAC was that there are instances in  which, due to the pitching of a floating crane \nand the pitching of the  vessel or object in the water with which a portal crane works, the  operator may \nhave to immediately release the brake. The concern is  that, if the foot pedal brake lock has been activated, \nthe operator may  not be able to release the brake quickly enough to prevent the  equipment from being \noverloaded or to prevent unintended movement of  the load.     As explained in the proposed rule, upon \nreview of the exemption in  the provision, the Agency realized that C-DAC assumed that the locking  device \nwould always be of the type that is located on the brake pedal.  That type of device can be difficult to \ndisengage, thereby delaying the  operator's ability to release the brake. However, there are other types  of \nbrake locking mechanisms that do not present this problem (for  example, a brake lock that is hand-actuated). \nThis raised the issue of  whether the exemption is needed. Consequently, OSHA asked for public  comment \non whether to change proposed Sec.  1926.1415(a)(4) by deleting  the exemption and requiring a hoist brake \nlocking mechanism for all  cranes.     OSHA received no comment on this issue. Therefore, OSHA has not  \nincluded the exemption in the final rule. The final paragraph (a)(4) is  published as proposed except that OSHA \nhas removed the phrase \"except  for portal cranes and floating cranes.\"     Integral Holding Device/Check \nValve: Paragraph (a)(5) requires that  hydraulic outrigger jacks have an integral holding device/check valve.  \nSuch a device is necessary to prevent the outrigger jack from  collapsing in the event of a hydraulic failu re. \n(See the discussion of  this provision in 73 FR 59786, Oct. 9, 2008.) OSHA is promulgating this  provision as \nproposed.     Two commenters, both of which had nominated C -DAC members,  suggested moving this \nrequirement to Sec.  1926.1433 (Design,  construction and testing) due to their belief that an integral holding  \ndevice/check valve is a design feature.

(ID -0175.1; -\n0205.1; -0211.1; - 0213.1.)     The Agency concludes that the commenters have misunderstood OSHA's  \nintent in this regard. Under Option (1) of this section, Sec.    1926.1427(b)(1), the accrediting agency must \nevaluate the \"written  testing materials\" as well as the \"practical examinations, test  administration, grading, \nfacilities/equipment and personnel\" to make  sure they all meet \"industry recognized criteria.\" The accrediting  \nagency therefore must evaluate the tests as well as their  administration to confirm that they meet industry \nrecognized criteria.     Just as the accrediting agency under Option (1) of this section  assesses written \ntesting materials and the practical test for  compliance with industry recognized criteria, under Option (2) of \nthis  section, as drafted by C-DAC and as written in the proposed rule, the  auditor must determine \"that the \nwritten and practical tests meet  nationally recognized test development criteria and are valid and  reliable \nin assessing the operator applicants * * *.\" (see Sec.   1926.1427(c)(1)(ii)(C)). No comments were received \nobjecting to those  requirements.     OSHA determines that C-DAC's intent in designing Option (2) was, in  \nessence, to have the auditor serve a role similar to that of the  accreditor in Option (1). The accreditor in \nOption (1) assesses the  tests as well as their administration to determine if they meet  \"industry recognized \ncriteria.\" As drafted by C-DAC, the auditor does  the same thing, both with respect to assessing the tests and \ntheir  administration.     The problem identifi ed by OSHA in the proposed rule relates to  auditing \nprocedure, not testing criteria. For example, the records that  the auditor would generate and maintain, the \nprocedures he/she would  use for obtaining documents that need to be examined to conduct the  audit, the \nthoroughness of the audit, and similar procedural matters  regarding the conduct of the audit need to accord \nwith nationally  recognized auditing standards. Section 1926.1427(c)(1)(ii)(C) shows  that C-DAC concluded \nthat it was important that the audit meet  nationally recognized auditing standards to help ensure the integrity  \nof the audit of the administration of the tests. OSHA determines that  it is equally important that the audit of \nthe tests themselves meet  those same procedural criteria. Therefore, the Agency has added new  Sec.  \n1926.1427(c)(1)(ii)(D).     Paragraph (c)(3) requires that the program be audited within three  months of its \ninception and every three years thereafter. The Agency  has added \"at least\" to the final rule to clarify that \nthe auditor  has the flexibility to perform audits more regularly if it so chooses.     Paragraph (c)(4) of this \nsection requires the employer's program to  have testing procedures for re-qualification designed to ensure \nthat  the operator continues to meet the technical knowledge and skills  requirement in Sec.  1926.1427(j). \nThe re-qualification procedures must  be audited in accordance with Sec. S ec.  1926.1427(c)(1) and (c)(2).      \nIn the event an auditor discovers a deficiency in an employer's  operator qualification program, the employer \nmust meet the requirements  set forth in paragraph (c)(5) of this section. Under paragraph  (c)(5)(i), no \nadditional operators may be qualified until the auditor  determines that the deficiency has been corrected. \nUnder paragraph  (c)(5)(ii), the program must be re -audited within 180 days of the  confirmation that the \ndeficiency was corrected. Paragraph (c)(5)(iii)  requires the auditor to file a report of any such deficiency with \nthe  appropriate OSHA Regional Office within 15 days of discovery. In  addition, paragraph (c)(5)(iv) requires \nthat records of the audits must  be maintained by the auditor for three years and must be made available  by \nthe auditor at the request of the Secretary of Labor or a designated  representative. The auditor's \nmaintenance of the records, and the  reporting requirement, are intended to preserve the independent  \nverification function of the auditor.",

In such  instances the employer will be required to develop \nand follow  substitute procedures.     Paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section specify qualifications  \ncriteria for those who develop two aspects of the substitute  procedures. Under Sec.  1926.1417(b)(2), \nprocedures for the operational  controls will have to be developed by a qualified person. As defined in  Sec.  \n1926.1401 of this standard, \"operational controls\" are levers,  switches, pedals and other devices for \ncontrolling equipment operation.  A qualified person has the requisite level of expertise to develop such  \nprocedures in l ight of both the complexity of the factors that must be  considered and the nature of the \noperational controls.     Under paragraph (b)(3), operational procedures related to equipment  capacity \nwould have to be developed and signed by a registered  professional engineer familiar with the equipment. \nThe type and  complexity of engineering analysis that is needed to develop safe  procedures related to \ncapacity necessitates that this work be done by a  registered professional engineer (RPE). In addition, because \ncapacity  is so critical to safe operation, a signature by the RPE is needed to  ensure that this work is done \nwith the requisite care. No comments were  submitted on this provision; therefore, it is promulgated as \nproposed. Paragraph (c) Accessibility of Procedures     Paragraph (c)(1) of this section requires employers to \nprovide the  operator with ready access in the cab to the procedures applicable to  the operation of the \nequipment, including the following: Rated  capacities (load charts), recommended operating speeds, special \nhazard  warnings, and the instructions and operator's manual.     For the purposes of this standard, \"special \nhazard warnings\" are  warnings of site-specific hazards (for example, proximity of power  lines). This term is \ndefined in Sec.  1926.1401 to differentiate these  site-specific warnings from all other general hazard \nwarnings which are  common to typical construction worksites.     Previously, former Sec.  1926.550(a)(2) \nof subpart N required rated  capacities, recommended operating speeds, and special hazard warnings  to be \nposted on the equipment, and instructions and warnings to be  visible at the operator's station. Unlike Se c.  \n1926.1417(c)(1) of this  standard, it did not require the operator's manual to be accessible to  the operator.     \nOSHA concludes that the information in these materials, including  the operator's manual, is essential for safe \ncrane operation. C-DAC  determined that this information is needed to help the operator avoid  performing \noperations beyond a crane's capacity and recommended  operating speed, and by increasing operator \nawareness of special  hazards related to a specific piece of equipment. In addition, C-DAC  determined that \nthis information needs to be available to the equipment  operator in the cab so that the operator can obtain \nthe information as  the need arises. If the information were not available in the cab,  operations would have \nto be delayed for the operator to leave the cab  and obtain the information elsewhere (or for someone else \nto obtain  them and bring them to the operator). The prospect of such a delay  would serve as a disincentive \nto obtaining the information and increase  the chance that operations would proceed without it.      A \nbuilding industry trade association stated its belief that the  cost of obtaining and maintaining manufacturers \nprocedures applicable  to operation of the equipment would be excessive, and stated that   OSHA's \ncontention that such costs would be \"modest\" was not supported  by the rulemaking record. (ID-0214.1.) This \ncommenter did not provide  any substantiation for this claim. Based on the absence of this  support, and on \nthe absence of other comments raising a cost objection  related to this requirement, OSHA concludes that the \ncost of obtaining  and maintaining manufacturers' procedures for equipment operations is  not generally \nviewed as significant, especially when weighed against  the potential economic and human costs of a crane \naccident. Moreover,  as noted below, the trend toward providing operating manuals and  procedures via",

A Succinct Statement of the \nNeed for, and Objectives of, the Rule      The primary objective of the proposed standard is to provide an  \nincreased degree of occupational safety for employees performing  construction work involving \ncranes/derricks. As stated above, an  estimated 157 injuries and 21 fatalities would be prevented annually  \nthrough compliance with this standard. Another objective of the  rulemaking is to provide employers and \nemployees updated and more  complete safety standards for con struction work involving cranes/  derricks.     \nThe legal basis for the rule is the Occupational Safety and Health  (OSH) Act of 1970. The OSH Act authorizes \nand obligates the Secretary  of Labor to promulgate mandatory occupational safety and health  standards as \nnecessary \"to assure so far as possible every working man  and woman in the Nation safe and healthful \nworking conditions and to  preserve our human resources.\" 29 U.S.C. 651(b).  3. Summary of the Significant \nIssues Raised by the Public Comments in  Response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, a Summary of  \nthe Assessment of the Agency of Such Issues, and a Statement of Any  Changes Made in the Proposed Rule as \na Result of Such Comments      On August 18, 2006, OSHA convened a Small Business Advocacy Review  \nPanel (the Panel) for this rulemaking in accordance with the provisions  of the Small Business Regulatory \nEnforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (Pub.  L. 104-121), as codified at 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. The Panel consisted of  \nrepresentatives of OSHA, the Office of Information and Regulatory  Affairs in the Office of Management and \nBudget, and of the Office of  Advocacy within the U.S. Small Business Administration. The Panel  received \noral and written comments on a draft proposal and a draft  economic analysis from small entities (businesses) \nthat would  potentially be affected by the rule. The Panel, in turn, prepared a  written report which was \ndelivered to the Assistant Secretary for  Occupational Safety and Health (which can be found in the docket for  \nthis rulemaking). The report summarized the comments received from the  small entities, and included \nrecommendations from the Panel to OSHA  regarding the proposal and the associated analysis of compliance \ncosts.  OSHA sought comment on a variety of issues of particular interest to  small businesses as a result of \nthe recommendations of the SBREFA  Panel. Table B -16 below summarizes the responses to these Panel  \nrecommendations.            Table B-16--Response to SBREFA Panel Recommendations ------------------------\n------------------------------------------------       SBREFA panel recommendation                 OSHA \nresponse ------------------------------------------------------------------------ The Panel recommends that OSHA provide   \nOSHA has developed a full   full documentation for how it            preliminar y economic analysis   \nestimated the number of affected small   (PEA) for the proposal which   entities and all other calculations      \nexplains all assumptions used   and estimates provided in the PIRFA.     in estimating the costs and                                            \nbenefits of the proposed                                            standard.

(ID-0199.1.) A witness testified that \nshift inspections are  not adequate to detect damage from previous use, dismantling, handling,  or shipping, \nand such damage could remain undetected until the next  comprehensive inspection unless a pre -erection \ninspection is conducted.  (ID-0341.)     Several witnesses who use tower cranes also testified in favor of  \npre-erection inspections and said that th ey routinely conduct such  inspections. (ID-0344.) For example, a \nrepresentative from a steel  erection contractor and crane vendor was asked by a public participant  if there \nis a benefit to require a pre-erection inspection of all  component parts by a qualified person. In response, he \ntestified that a  pre-erection inspection is done routinely anyway because his company is  required to inspect \nthe crane components before erection to make sure  the components were not damaged during shipping. (ID-\n0344.)     In addition, one commenter noted that ASME B30.3 (2003),  Construction Tower Cranes, includes \na provision on pre -erection  inspections, which suggests that such inspections are routinely  conducted in \nthe industry. (ID -0405.1.) The ASME B30.3 provision reads:      3-1.1.2(g). Before crane components are \nerected, they shall be  visually inspected for damage from shipping and handling. Dented,  bent, torn, gouged, \nor otherwise damaged structural members shall  not be erected until repaired in accordance with the \nmanufacturer's  or a qualified person's instructions, or replaced.   Although the record contains substantial \nsupport for pre-erection  inspections, it also reflects different views regarding the appropriate  scope of such \nan inspection. One commenter recommended an inspection of  \"the tower crane's component parts.\" (ID -\n0182.1.) As noted above, the ASME  B30.3 standard similarly refers to \"crane components.\" Another  \ncommenter listed the turntable, jib, and boom as items to be inspected.  (ID-0199.1.) One witness at the \nhearing stated that the pre -erection  inspection should include the tower, turntable, jib, counterjib,  \nmachinery, masts, boom, and pendants. (ID -0341.) However, the  organization represented by that witness \nsubmitted a considerably  longer list of items it believed should be inspected. (ID -0333.)  Another witness \nfavored pre-erection inspections of \"major  components\" but could not offer a more specific definition than  \n\"components that, if they failed, would have a catastrophic result.\"  (ID-0344.)     In light of the record, \nOSHA concludes that pre -erection  inspections should be required for tower cranes, with such inspect ions  \nfocused on discovering defects that would be difficult to detect during  the shift inspections that will be \nconducted regularly after the crane  is put in service. By focusing the inspection on such components, the  \npre-erection inspection will address the concern expressed by  commenters that some defects will be difficult \nto detect during shift  inspections after the crane is erected.      OSHA is requiring the pre -erection \ninspection to be conducted by a  \"qualified person.\" The final rule requires that certain other  inspections be \nconducted by a qualified person, including the post - erection inspection required by Sec.  1926.1412(c) a nd \nthe annual/ comprehensive inspection required by Sec.  1926.1412(f). As discussed  below, under the pre-\nerection inspection required by this final rule,  the individual conducting the inspection must make decisions \nsimilar to  those that must be made during the annual/comprehensive inspection,  i.e., deciding whether a \ndeficiency would be an immediate safety hazard  or whether it requires scrutiny during the monthly \ninspections. Since  the pre -erection inspection requires the same degree of expertise as  the \nannual/comprehensive inspections, paragraph (f)(2) is similarly  requiring the pre-erection inspection to be \nconducted by a qualified  person.     Paragraph (f)(2)(i) requires the qualified person to pay particular  \nattention to components that will be difficult to inspect thoroughly  during shift inspections. As noted above, \ninspection of such components  was a special concern of commenters who believed that pre -erection  \ninspections should be required.      The shift, monthly, and annual inspections r equired under Sec.",

(See additional explanation at 73 FR 59795, Oct. 9, 2008.) No comments  were \nsubmitted on this paragraph; it is promulgated as proposed.  Paragraph (y)     This paragraph requires that \nthe operator obey a stop or emergency  stop signal, regardless of who gives the signal. Any person on a  \nworksite may observe a hazardous condition that is not visible to or  recognized by the crane operator an d \nthat can only be avoided if the  equipment stops immediately, so it is imperative that the operator  respond \nimmediately to any such signal by anyone. No comments were  submitted on this paragraph; it is promulgated \nas proposed. Paragraph (z) Swinging Locomotive Cranes     Pursuant to this paragraph, a locomotive crane \nmust not be swung  into a position where railway cars on an adjacent track could strike  it, until it is \ndetermined that cars are not being moved on the  adjacent track and that proper flag  protection has been \nestablished.  The Agency is including this paragraph to prevent contact between the  locomotive cranes and \nrailway cars, and notes comparable requirements  in Sec.  1910.180(i)(6) and sec. 5 -3.4.4 of ANSI B30.5-1968. \nNo  comments were submitted on this paragraph, and it is promulgated with  only one modification. The \nproposed rule incorporated an additional  determination of whether it would be \"reasonably fo reseeable\" \nthat  other railway cars on an adjacent track could strike the locomotive  crane. OSHA concludes that when \na locomotive crane swings into a  position where it is physically possible for a railway car on an  adjacent \ntrack to strike it, a hazard is present and the additional  language would serve only to generate confusion \nabout the appropriate  response to that hazard. The concepts of reasonableness and  forseeability are \ntypically raised during legal processes and would be  factored into those processes in accordance with law. \nParagraph (aa) Counterweight/Ballast      Section 1926.1417(aa)(1) contains counterweight/ballast  \nrequirements that apply to equipment other than tower cranes and are  intended to prevent unintended \nmovement, tipover, and c ollapse. As  noted in Sec.  1926.1417(aa)(2), requirements regarding \ncounterweight/ ballast for tower cranes are found in Sec.  1926.1435(b)(8).      Section 1926.1417(aa)(1)(i) \nrequires that equipment not be operated  without the counterweight or ballast i n place as specified by the  \nmanufacturer.     Section 1926.1417(aa)(1)(ii) prohibits the employer from exceeding  the maximum \ncounterweight or ballast specified by the manufacturer for  the equipment. Exceeding that maximum could \nresult in component  failure, which could cause unintended movement, tipover or collapse. No  comments \nwere submitted on this provision, and it is promulgated as  proposed. Section 1926.1418 Authority To Stop \nOperation     This section provides that whenever there is a concern as to  safety, the operator has the \nauthority to stop and refuse to handle  loads until a qualified person has determined that safety has been  \nassured. Section 1926.1401 defines \"qualified person\" as a person  who, by possession of a recognized degree, \ncertificate, or professional  standing, or who by extensive knowledge, training and experience,  successfully \ndemonstrated the ability to solve/resolve problems  relating to the subject matter, the work, or the project.     \nSection 1926.1418 continues the long -standing requirements under  subpart N and current consensus \nstandards. (See former Sec.   1926.550(b)(2), incorporating by reference ANSI B30.5 -1968, sec. 5 - \n3.1.3(d).\\88\\) As discussed in the proposed rule preamble, a capable  equipment operator is highly \nknowledgeable in matters affecting  equipment safety and is well qualified to determine whether an  \noperation presents a safety concern (see 73 FR 59795-59796, Oct. 9,  2008).",

It states that  digger derricks used for augering holes for electrical poles, placing  and removing \nthe poles, or handling associated materials to be  installed or removed from the poles must comply with 29 \nCFR 1910.269.  This provision ensures comparable safety requirements exist for digger  derricks performing \nelectrical pole work.      What was Sec.  1926.952(c)(2) prior to the promulgation of this  final rule has \nbeen redesignated Sec.  1926.952(c)(3). Former  Sec. Sec.  1926.952(c)(2)(i) and (ii) listed precautions for \noperating  mechanical equipment closer to energized power lines than allowed by  Sec.  1926.950(c). The \nprecautions (using an insulated barrier and  grounding the equipment) that were specified in Sec. Sec.   \n1926.952(c)(2)(i) and (ii) are now required under Sec.  1926.1410(d)  when equipment used in subpart V \nwork is operated closer t han the Table  V-1 clearances. Since these precautions are now required by Sec.   \n1926.1410(d), OSHA is deleting them from subpart V. As a result of that  deletion, former Sec. Sec.  \n1926.952(c)(2)(iii) and (iv) are  redesignated Sec. Sec.  1926.952(c)(3)( i) and (ii).     OSHA is also adding a \nnote after new Sec.  1926.952(c)(3) to cross - reference the safe harbor in Sec.  1926.1400(g), which provides \nthat  employers performing subpart V work have the option of complying with  29 CFR 1910.269(p) in lieu of \nthe requirements in Sec. Sec.  1926.1407  through 1926.1411 of new subpart CC. For additional information, \nsee  the discussion of Sec.  1926.1400(g) in the preamble to this final  rule.  Subpart X--Stairways and \nLadders  Amendment to Sec.  1926.1050 Scope,  Application, and Definitions  Applicable to This Subpart      \nThis section applies the provisions of subpart X to all stairways  and ladders used in construction. However, C-\nDAC concluded that the  OSHA requirements of subpart X did not account for the cha racteristics  of the \nequipment that would be regulated by subpart CC. OSHA agreed  with the committee and, accordingly, is \namending Sec.  1926.1050(a) to  explain that subpart X does not apply to integral components of  \nequipment covered by subpart CC. It further explains that only subpart  CC establishes the circumstances \nwhen ladders and stairways must be  provided on equipment covered by subpart CC. This revision is also  \ndiscussed in the preamble section for Sec.  1926.1423(c).   Appendix A to Part 1926 Designations for General \nIndustry Standards  Incorporated Into Body of Construction Standards      OSHA modified Appendix A to \npart 1926. Before the promulgation of  this final rule, Appendix A referred to former Sec.  1926.550(a)(19),  \nwhich has been redesignated and reserved. Therefore, the reference to  this section and the reference to the \ngeneral industry standard it  incorporated, Sec.  1910.184(c)(9), have been deleted . This deletion is  a \ntechnical and conforming change, does not change any existing rights  or obligations, and no member of the \nregulated community is likely to  object to it. OSHA, therefore, finds good cause that the opportunity  for \npublic comment is u nnecessary within the meaning of 5 U.S.C.  553(b)(3)(B), 29 U.S.C. 655(b), and 29 CFR \n1911.5  29 CFR Part 1926 Subpart CC      The Agency is promulgating Subpart CC for regulating the use of  \ncranes and derricks in construction. Cranes and derricks used in   construction had been regulated by Sec.  \n1926.550. Accordingly, Sec.   1926.550 has been redesignated and reserved.",

Under paragraph (k)(6), where the \nplatform is not equipped with any  controls, the equipment operator is required to remain at the equipment  \ncontrols at all times while the personnel platform is occupied. Because  there are no controls in the personnel \nplatform, the equipment operator  must be available to make any necessary adjustments to protect the  \nemployees from injury from any condition a rising after the platform is  placed at the working location. \nParagraph (k)(6) requires the operator  to stay at the equipment controls, and on site and in view of the  \nequipment, at all times the platform is occupied, whether or not the  crane engine is r unning. Equipment \ncontrols, as discussed here and in  Sec.  1926.1431(k)(7), include remote controls that are used to control  \nthe boom and swing functions of the equipment. This subpart does not  prohibit the use of remote controls \nfor equipment by an ope rator. See  discussion of the use of remote controls at the preamble for Sec.   \n1926.1417(e)(1). The Agency has added the \"on site and in view of the  equipment\" requirement in the final \nrule to address the situation  where the operator uses a remote control to operate the equipment. The  same \nrequirement was included in proposed Sec.  1926.1431(k)(7) to  address the same issue, and is included in \nfinal Sec.  1926.1431(k)(7),  as discussed below.      No comments were received on paragraphs (k)(1) \nthrough (k )(6); they  are promulgated as proposed with the exception of the addition noted  for (k)(6).     \nParagraph (k)(7), Platforms with controls, applies when a personnel  platform has controls. Controls on certain \npersonnel platforms enable a  platform occupant to move both the platform and the boom. Other  platform \ndesigns enable an occupant to control only the platform/basket  itself, for example, to level the basket as it is \nboomed up or down.     Paragraph (k)(7)(i) requires the platform occupant using the  platform's controls to \nbe a qualified person with respect to their use,  including the safe limitations of the equipment and hazards \nassociated  with its operation. Such knowledge and skill is essential for the  safety of the platform occupants \nand employees in the surrounding area.     Proposed paragraph (k)(7)(ii) required the equipment operator \nto be  at the equipment controls, in the personnel platform, or on site and in  view of the equipment. In the \nproposed rule, the Agency requested  public comment on whether this paragraph should be reworded to \nclarify  the circumstances for selecting a location for the equipment operator  (73 FR 59835, Oct. 9, 2008). \nTwo commenters stated that, regardless of  which option is chosen, the operator must be in a position that \nallows  him to control the boom and swing functions of the equipment. (ID- 0205.1; -0213.1.) However, these \ncommenters also stated that the  proposed regulatory text did not need to be revised. (ID -0205.1; -0213.1.)     \nUpon reviewing the paragraph as proposed and considering these  comments, OSHA finds that the language \nused in proposed  1926.1431(k)(7)(ii) needs to be changed to clearly specify that an  operator has to be able \nto control the boom and swing functions,  wherever the operator is located. If the platform does not have  \ncontrols for the boom and swing functions of the equipment, then it is  essential that the operator be at the \nset of equipment controls which  include these functions, because they are crucial for the safety of  \npersonnel being hoisted. These equipment controls may be on the  platform, in the cab, or on a remote control. \nThe operator must be able  to take immediate action when necessary (such as, for example, when  there is \nunexpected platform or equipment movement, a sudden change in  wind conditions, or an injury to a platform \noccupant).",

It makes clear that  the guardra il criteria requirements in Sec.  \n1926.502(b) for those  items do not apply to equipment covered by subpart CC. Instead,  Sec. Sec.  \n1926.1423(c)(2), (3), and (4), discussed below, provide the  applicable criteria for such equipment. Because of \nthe addition of  paragraph (c)(1), which was not in the proposed rule, paragraphs  (c)(2), (3), and (4) have \nbeen renumbered from the proposal, where they  were paragraphs (c)(1), (2), and (3).     Paragraph (c)(2) \nof this section requires that the employer  maintain in good condition originally-equipped steps, handholds,  \nladders and guardrails/railings/grabrails. \\97\\ The failure to properly  maintain such devices could pose \ndangers to the workers who use them.  For example, a grabrail would not be maintained in good condition if \nit  has become weakened from rust. A weakened guardrail could fail when an  employee uses it, which could \ncause the employee to fall. Likewise, a  railing would not be maintained in good condition if all or part of the  \nrailing is missing. A manufacturer that integrated a railing into its  boom design may have relied on the \npresence of the railing and provided  a walking surface that would otherwise be too narrow to be safe. -------\n--------------------------------------------------------------------      \\97\\ OSHA has changed the location of the words \n\"in good  condition\" in Sec.  1926.1423(b) to make it clear that it applies  to maintenance of all of the listed \nitems. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      Paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this \nsection require that equipment  manufactured more than one year after the effective date of this  standard \nbe equipped to provide safe access and egress on equipment  covered by this subpart by the provision of \ndevices such as steps,  handholds, ladders, and guardrails/railings/grabrails. Tower cranes  must be equipped \nto provide safe access and egress between the ground  and the cab, machinery platforms, and tower (mast) \n(see below  discussion of paragraph (c)(4)). All other equipment covered by this  subpart must be equipped \nto provide safe access and egress between the  ground and the operator work station(s), including the forward \nand rear  operator positions. As discussed below, Sec. Sec.  1926.1423(c)(3)(i)  and 1926.1423(c)(4)(i) \nrequire the steps, handholds, ladders and  guardrails/railings/grabrails used to comply with this section to \nmeet  updated design criteria.      Prior to this final rule, former Sec.  1926.550(a)(13)(i) in  subpart N \nrequired that guardrails, handholds, and steps be provided on  cranes for easy access to the car and cab and \nspecified that these  devices conform to ANSI B30.5. The 1968 version of ANSI B30.5, which  was in effect at \nthe time subpart N was issued, specifies that the  construction of these devices must conform to the 1946 U.S. \nSafety  Appliance Standard. C-DAC recognized that many pieces of equipment now  in use would have been \nmanufactured with handholds and steps but was  concerned that the handholds and steps may have been \ndesigned to meet  outdated criteria.     The Committee determined, and OSHA agrees, that it would be \nunduly  burdensome to require all equipment to be retrofitted with new steps,  handholds, and railings \nsimply because the existing design may vary  from what is required under the final rule. Accordingly, Sec.   \n1926.1423(c)(3) only applies to equipment manufactured more than one  year after the effective date of this \nstandard. This gives equipment  manufacturers adequate time to incorporate the requirements of Sec.   \n1926.1423(c)(3)(i) into their new products. \\98\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \n\\98\\ OSHA had added the word \"devices\" in the last sentence of  paragraph (c)(3) for grammatical clarity.",

Amendments to Standards   II. Background  A. History      The \nOccupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (84 Stat. 1590, 29  U.S.C. 651 et seq.) (the OSH Act) authorizes the \nSecretary of Labor to  adopt safety and health standards to reduce injuries and illnesses in  American \nworkplaces. Pursuant to that authority, the Secretary adopted  a set of safety and health standards applicable \nto the construction  industry, 29 CFR part 1926. Initially, standards for the construction  industry were \nadopted under the Construction Safety Act, 40 U.S.C. 333.  Under the Construction Safety Act, those standards \nwere limited to  employers engaged in Federally-financed or Federally-assisted  construction projects. The \nSecretary subsequently adopted them as OSHA  standards pursuant to Sec. 6(a) of the OSH Act, 29 U.S. C. \n655(a),  which authorized the Secretary to adopt established Federal standards  as OSH Act standards within \nthe first two years the OSH Act was  effective (see 36 FR 25232, Dec. 30, 1971). Subpart N of 29 CFR part  \n1926, entitled \"Cranes, Derricks, Hoists, Elevat ors, and Conveyors,\"  was originally adopted through this \nprocess.     The section of subpart N of 29 CFR part 1926 that applied to cranes  and derricks was former \nSec.  1926.550. That section relied heavily on  national consensus standards that were in effect in 1971, in \nsome cases  incorporating the consensus standards by reference. For example, former  Sec.  1926.550(b)(2) \nrequired crawler, truck, and locomotive cranes to  meet applicable requirements for design, inspection, \nconstruction,  testing, maintenance, and operation prescribed in ANSI B30.5 -1968,  \"Crawler, Locomotive \nand Truck Cranes.\" Similarly, former Sec.   1926.550(e) required derricks to meet applicable requirements for \ndesign,  construction, installation, inspection, testing, maintenance, and  operation prescribed in ANSI \nB30.6-1969, \"Derricks.\" Until today,  former Sec.  1926.550 was amended substantively only twice. In 1988,  \nformer Sec.  1926.550(g) was added to establish clearly the conditions  under which employees on personnel \nplatforms may be hoisted by cranes  and derricks (see 53 FR 29116, Aug. 2, 1988). In 1993, former Sec.   \n1926.550(a)(19) was added to require that all employees be kept clear  of lifted and suspended loads.      \nConsiderable technological advances have been made since the 1971  OSHA standard was issued. For example, \nhydraulic cranes were rare at  that time, but are now prevalent. In addition, the construction  industry has \nupdated the consensus standards on which the original OSHA  standard was based.",

The Agency is providing minor clarifications for \nthe two apparent  deficiencies that relate to damage from electricity. As proposed,  paragraph (a)(2)(i)(C) \nread: \"Electric arc (from a source other than  power lines) or heat damage.\" C-DAC intended that both \"electric  \narc\" and \"heat\" would modify \"damage.\" To make this more clear,  OSHA is adding the word \"damage\" after \n\"electric arc.\" Proposed  paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(B) read: \"Electrical contact with a power  line.\" OSHA is adding \nthe word \"prior\" at the beginning of the  paragraph to clarify that the inspector must note a deficiency \nwhenever  he or she is aware, through observation or from any other information,  that the wire rope has \npreviously made electrical contact with a power  line.     OSHA notes that a wire rope can be damaged in \ntwo ways from  electrical contact. First, if the source of electrical power contacts  the wire rope, the \nelectricity can arc to the wire rope and cause a  localized burn. The extent of the damage will depend on the \namount of  electrical energy involved. A low energy arc will typically cause  little damage; a high energy arc",

Unlike  subpart N, which had required employers to calculate the \nminimum  clearance distance from a formula, Table A sets forth specified  clearance distances in a readily \nunderstood table and requires no  calculations. In addition to maintaining the minimum clearance distance  \nspecified in the Table, employers using this option are required to  implement the encroachment prevention \nand other measures specified in  proposed Sec.  1926.1407(b).      Several commenters verified C -DAC's \ndetermination that obtaining  voltage information in practice can often be difficult and time- consuming. (ID-\n0118; -0143.1; -0146.1; -0155.1.) OSHA determines that  providing a mechanism under Sec.  1926.1407(a)(2) \n(\"Option (2)\") to  proceed with construction operations without having to obtain voltage  information from \nutilities provides employers with a viable alternative  to obtaining voltage information without compromising \nthe safety of  workers. This section of the final rule provides a mechanism by which  employers can, using \nTable A, perform work with clearance distances of  less than 20 feet. It is promulgated as proposed.\\29\\ ------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------      \\29\\ The proposed regulatory text for Sec.  \n1926.1407(a)(3)(i)  used the phrase \"minimum clearance distance\" while that for Sec.   1926.1407(a)(3)(ii) \nused \"minimum approach distance.\" For  consistency, OSHA has, in Sec.  1926.1407(a)(3)(ii), changed the  \nphrase \"minimum approach distance\" to \"minimum clearance  distance.\" Provisions in Sec.  1910.269 and \nproposed subpart V of  29 CFR 1926 use the phrase \"minimum approach distance.\" OSHA  believes that \nemployers who are covered by those standards are  familiar with that term. In contrast, the Agency believes \nthat  employers that do not perform electric power work will better  understand the term \"minimum \nclearance distances.\" OSHA considers  the terms \"approach distance\" and \"clearance distance\" to be  \ninterchangeable; no substantive distinctions are intended. --------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------  Paragraph (b) Preventing Eencroachment/Electrocution     Once an employer has determined that \nsome part of the crane, load  or load line could come within the trigger distance of 20 feet of a  power line \n(see Sec.  1926.1407(a)), if it chooses either Option (2) or  (3) of Sec.  1926.1407(a) it is required to \nimplement encroachment  prevention measures to help ensure that the applicable minimum  clearance \ndistance (20 feet under Option (2) or the Table A distance  under Option (3) is not breached.\\30\\ ---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------      \\30\\ Alternatively, under Option (1), the employer could \nhave  the lines deenergized and grounded. If Option (1) were selected, no  further action under this section \nwould be required.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      Most of the measures in \nthis paragraph are designed to help the  employer maintain the appropriate clearance distance and thereby  \nprevent electrical contact while in the process of assembling or  disassembling equipment. One of the \nmeasures is designed to prevent  electrocution in the event of electrical contact. Paragraph (b)(1)     Under \nparagraph (b)(1) of t his section, the employer is required to  conduct a planning meeting with the \nAssembly/Disassembly Director \\31\\  (A/D Director), operator, assembly/disassembly crew and other workers  \nwho will be in the assembly/disassembly area (including the area of the   load). This planning meeting must \ninclude reviewing the location of the  power line(s) and the steps that will be implemented to prevent  \nencroachment and electrocution.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\31\\ As \nexplained in the preamble accompanying Sec.  1926.1404,  the term \"assembly/disassembly director\" \nreplaces the proposed  term \"assembly/disassembly supervisor.\" ---------------------------------------------------------\n------------------      In the planning meeting, the employer is required to select a  protective measure from \nparagraph (b)(3) of this section (see  discussion below) and review all the measures tha t will be used to  \ncomply with this section.     The purpose of the meeting requirement is to ensure that the  operator and",

(ID-0209.1.)  Another commenter recommended that refresher training be done every 3  \nyears or earlier when based on evaluation of employee conduct. (ID - 0182.1.)     The Agency finds these \ncomments to be unpersuasive. As proposed,  the employer is required to retrain an employee based on the  \nindividual's conduct. OSHA determines this promotes a more effective  retraining requirement than one based \non time or type of coursework.     Therefore, paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section are  promulgated as \nset forth in the proposed rule. As noted above, the  Agency is adding new paragraph (g)(3) to clarify that \nemployers are  responsible to provide the training required under subpart CC at no  cost to employees.      \nThe following chart summarizes the location of the training  requirements in the final rule:  ---------------------\n---------------------------------------------------                 Section                        Training \nrequirement ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Sec.

This section replaces  the requirements of subpart N, former Sec.  \n1926.550(g). Those  requirements have been effective in reducing accidents and as a result  most of the \nrequirements have been continued in this rule. However,  while continuing most of the hoisting personnel \nrequirements that were  in subpart N, subpart CC clarifies requirements where needed and has  added \nrequirements for certain activities, such as hoisting personnel  in a drill shaft, as discussed below.

To assess the potential economic impact of the \nproposal on small  entities, OSHA calculated the ratios of compliance costs to profits and  to revenues. These \nimpacts are presented for each affected industry in  Table B-14. OSHA expects that, among small entities \npotentially  affected by the proposal, the average increase in prices necessary to  completely offset the \ncompliance costs is 0.06 percent. The average  price increase necessary to completely offset compliance costs \nwould  not exceed 0.18 percent among small entities in any industry. Only to  the extent that such price \nincreases are not possible would there be  any effect on the average profits of small entities. Even in the  \nunlikely event that no costs could be passed through, the compliance  costs could be completely absorbed \nthrough an average reduction in  profits of 1.2 percent. In most affected industries,  the compliance  costs, \nwithout any pass-through, could be completely absorbed through  an average reduction in profits of less than \n1 percent; the reduction  would be no more than 5.0 percent in any of the affected industries.     To further \nensure that p otential impacts on small entities were  fully analyzed and considered, OSHA also separately \nexamined the  potential impacts of the final standard on very small entities, defined  as employers with \nfewer than 20 employees. To assess the potential  economic impact of the final standard on very small entities, \nOSHA  calculated the ratios of compliance costs to profits and to revenues.  These ratios are presented for \neach affected industry in Table B-15.  OSHA expects that among very small entities potentially affected by the  \nfinal standard, the average increase in prices necessary to completely  offset the compliance costs would be \n0.08 percent (less than 1  percent). Only to the extent that such price increases are not  possible, would there \nbe any effect on the average profits of very  small entities.

Total costs with 3% \ndiscount rate: $150.4    million annually.       During the SBREFA process, several Small Entity \nRepresentatives  expressed concern that the C -DAC Document was so long and complex that  small \nbusinesses would have difficulty understanding it and complying  with it. The SBREFA Panel recommended \nthat OSHA solicit public comment  on how the rule could be simplified and made easier to understand. In  \nthe proposal, OSHA requested public comment on this issue. The Agency  did not receive any comments \nobjecting to the length or clarity of the  overall rule, or any comment on how to simplify the final rule. Some  \ncommenters recommended that specific provisions be clarified, and these  comments are addressed later in \nthis preamble.  III. The SBREFA Process       Before proceeding with a proposed rule based on the C -DAC \nDocument,  OSHA was required to comply with the Small Business Regulatory  Enforcement Fairness Act of \n1996, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. (SBREFA). This  process required OSHA to draft an initial regulatory flexibility  \nanalysis that would evaluate the potential impact of the rule on small  entities (defined as small businesses, \nsmall governmental units, and  small nonprofit organizations) and identify the type of small entities  that \nmay be affected by the rule. In accordance with SBREFA, OSHA then  convened a Small Business Advocacy \nReview Panel (\"Panel\") composed of  representatives of OSHA, the Offic e of Management and Budget, and \nthe  Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration. Individuals  who were representative of \naffected small entities (i.e., Small Entity  Representatives, or \"SERs\") were identified for the purpose of  \nobtaining advice and recommendations regarding the potential impacts of  the proposed rule.      OSHA \nprovided the SERs with the C-DAC Document and the draft  Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, and requested that \nthey submit written  comments on these documents. The Agenc y also drafted questions asking  for their \nviews on the specific aspects of the C-DAC Document that OSHA  believed may be of concern to small entities.     \nThe Panel conducted two conference calls with the SERs in which the  SERs presented their views on various \nissues. After reviewing the SERs'  oral and written comments, on October 17, 2006, the Panel submitted its  \nreport summarizing the requirements of the C-DAC proposal and the  comments received from the SERs, and \npresenting its findings and  recommendations. (OSHA -S030A-2006-0664-0019.) In its findings and  \nrecommendations, the Panel identified issues that it believed OSHA  should address in the pro posal (1) \nthrough further analysis, and (2) by  soliciting public comment. In the proposed rule, OSHA addressed each of  \nthe Panel's findings and recommendations in the section pertaining to  the issue involved, and also solicited \npublic comment on the issues  raised by the Panel. The following table lists the recommendations made  by",

In this final rule,  OSHA is clarifying the definition to make it clear that the controlling  entity must be an \nemployer.     Section 1926.1402(c)(1) requires the controlling entity to ensure  that ground preparations \nnecessary to meet the requirements in  paragraph (b) of this section are provided. The Committee determined  \nthat it is necessary to specify who will have ground condition  responsibility because in many instances the \nparties are unable to  agree on who will have (or has) that contractual responsibility, with  the result that \noften no one corrects inadequate ground cond itions.     In the Committee's view, the crane user and \noperator typically do  not have the equipment or authority to make such preparations. In  contrast, the \ncontrolling entity, due to its control of the worksite,  has the requisite authority and is in the best position to \narrange for  adequate ground conditions. The Committee was concerned, however, that  some controlling \nentities may lack the expertise to recognize when  ground conditions are inadequate. To address this concern, \nthe  Committee developed Sec.  1926.1402(e).      One commenter said that adequate site assessment \nrequires defining  ground bearing capacity compared to loading of the machine, along with  soil testing and \nproper analysis for ground conditions. (ID-0143.1.) As  explained in the preamble of the proposed rule, C-DAC \nconsidered, but  rejected, including specification requirements regarding the soil  conditions (see 73 FR \n59739-59740, Oct. 9, 2008). This reflected the  view that most sites and circumstances do not require \nsophisticated  soil testing. In light of C-DAC's decision not to add new testing or  soil specifications, the many \nvariables that may affect ground  conditions, and the existing body of law and OSHA guidance relating to  \ntesting duties under the Agency's multi-employer policy, the Agency  concludes that it is appropriate to allow \nthe controlling entity  flexibility in the manner in which it satisfies its duties under Sec.   1926.1402 and the \nmulti-employer policy.     Under Sec.  1926.1402(c)(2), the controlling entity is required to  inform the \nuser of the equipment and the equipment operator of the  location of hazards beneath the equipment set-up \narea (such as voids,  tanks, and utilities, including sewer, water supply, and drain pipes)  that are identified \nin documents (such as site drawings, as -built  drawings, and soil analyses) that are in the possession of the  \ncontrolling entity. These undergrou nd hazards can compromise the  ability of the ground above them to \nsupport the equipment. In the  experience of members of the Committee, because of the hidden nature of  \nthese hazards, accidents have occurred when cranes have been set up  above such hazards and a portion of \nthe ground has given way.     In developing this provision, the Committee was mindful that the  controlling \nentity often possesses documents obtained or developed  during the ordinary course of business that identify \nthe location of  such hazards. Under the provision as proposed, if the controlling  entity has such a document, \nwhether at the site or at an off-site  location, it is required to inform the equipment user and operator of  the \nlocation of the hazard as identified in it. If th e controlling  entity does not possess the information, it is not \nrequired to obtain  it from another source. The Committee concluded that requiring the  controlling entity \nto obtain such information from other sources would,  in effect, require it to arrange for testing. As explained \nabove, the  Committee determined such a duty would be unduly burdensome and  unnecessary.     Some \ncommenters indicated that clarification is needed regarding  whether the controlling entity is required to \npossess particular  documents. (ID-0166.1; -0214.1.) OSHA agrees that additional  clarification is needed and \nis making two changes in the f inal text of  paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Both of these clarifications are  \nconsistent with the rationale of the rule that the controlling entity  need only share information that it",

OSHA is  rejecting that suggestion for the same reason given in relation to  paragraph (e)(2). No \nother objections to prop osed paragraph (c)(3)  (final paragraph (e)(3)) were received. Accordingly, with the \nsingle  exception just mentioned in regard to final paragraph (e)(3)(iii),  proposed paragraph (c)(3) is being \npromulgated as final Sec.   1926.1414(e)(3). Paragraph (e)(4) Additional Requirements for Rotation Resistant \nRope  for Boom Hoist Reeving     Paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section prohibits rotation resistant  rope from \nbeing used for boom hoist reeving except where the  requirements of paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section are \nmet. C-DAC  members determined that the general prohibition was necessary because,  in their experience, \nrotation resistant rope used for boom hoist  reeving tends to twist and thereby suffer internal damage when \nit  passes over sheaves that are  close together. However, C -DAC concluded  that safety would not be \ncompromised when rotation resistant rope is  used for boom hoist reeving as long as the conditions in \nparagraph (e)(4)(ii)  of this section are met.      The Committee also determined that the exception would \nserve a  practical purpose, especially when using attachments such as luffing  jibs. The auxi liary hoist is \ntypically used as a boom hoist for such  attachments, and is normally rigged with rotation resistant rope. The  \nexception enables the employer to avoid the need to change the rope  when using such attachments when \nsafety could be assured by meeting the  specified conditions for its use.      The conditions under which \nrotation resistant rope may be used for  boom hoist reeving were contained in proposed paragraph (c)(4). No  \nsubstantive objections to that proposed paragraph were received. Two  commenters stated that the phrase \n\"rated capacity\" in proposed  paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(F) should be replaced with \"rated load  capacity.\" (ID-\n0205.1; -0213.1.) As noted in the proposed rule, the C - DAC proposal attributed the same meaning to both \n\"rated cap acity\" and  \"rated load capacity,\" and OSHA is consistently using the term  \"rated capacity\" \nwherever C -DAC used either term to avoid any  confusion (see 73 FR 59738, Oct. 9, 2008). Accordingly, \nproposed  paragraph (c)(4) is being promulgated as final para graph (e)(4) without  substantive change. \nParagraph (f)     Proposed paragraph (d) of this section specified that wire rope  clips used with wedge \nsockets may only be attached to the unloaded dead  end of the rope, except that devices specifically designed \nfor dead  ending rope in a wedge socket are also permitted.      The Committee concluded that this \nprovision was necessary to ensure  attachment strength, reliability and prevention of cable damage. No  \ncomments concerning this provision were submitted, an d OSHA is  promulgating it as Sec.  1926.1414(f).  \nParagraph (g)     Proposed paragraph (e) of this section stated that socketing must  be done according to \nthe specifications of the manufacturer of the wire  rope or fitting. No comments regarding this provision were \nreceived,  and OSHA is promulgating it as Sec.  1926.1414(g).  Paragraph (h)     Proposed paragraph (f) of \nthis section specified that seizings must  be placed on each side of the point to be cut before the wire rope is  \ncut. It also specified that the length and number of seizings must be  in accordance with the instructions of \nthe wire rope manufacturer.     Seizings are needed to hold the wire in the strands and the strands  in place \nduring handling while cutting, thereby keeping the rope beyond  the area of the cut intact. In the Committee's \nexperience, the  instructions and procedures for seizing differ among various wire rope  manufacturers.",

C-DAC determined \nthat certification under  this option should be portable because the testing organization is  fully independent \nof all employers who may employ a crane operator and  there is no reason to limit the certification to a \nparticular employer.  OSHA agrees.      Section 1926.1427(b)(4) (previously des ignated Sec.   \n1926.1427(b)(3) in the proposed rule) provides that a certification  under this paragraph is valid for exactly \nfive years. The exact five  year period is intended to strike the appropriate balance between ensuring  that \ncertified operators a re re -evaluated regularly, while reducing the burden  of recertification on operators.      \nNo comments were received on the text that is now in paragraphs  (b)(3) and (b)(4). As noted, the definition \nof \"portable\" has been  moved from proposed (m)(1) to final (b)(3). Paragraph (c) Option (2): Qualification by \nan Audited Employer Program     Paragraph (c) of this section sets out Option (2), in which the  employer \ndetermines, through its own audited testing program, that its  employee is qualified to operate the equipment. \nThis option is designed  to enable employers to meet the Sec.  1926.1427 requirements through  their own \nin-house testing programs. As discussed above, however, C -DAC  determined that independent, third-party \ninvolvement was needed to  ensure the reliability and integrity of any testing program. Therefore,  to ensure \nthat testing under Option (2) of this section is accurate and  reliable, Sec.  1926.1427(c)(1) requires that the \ntests must be  developed by either an accredited crane operator testing organization  (as described under \nOption (1)), or approved by an auditor who is  certified by an accredited crane operator testing organization. \nIn  addition, the administration of the tests must be audited.      If the employer chooses to use tests \napproved by an auditor, the  auditor must, under Sec.  1926.1427(c)(1)(ii)(A), be certified as a  test \nevaluator by an accredited testing organization. To ensure that  the auditor's evaluation is independent and \nimpartial, Sec.   1926.1427(c)(1)(ii)(B) prohibits the auditor from being employed by the  employer seeking \nevaluation of its qualification program. Also,  Sec.   1926.1427(c)(1)(ii)(C) requires the auditor to determine \nthat the  program meets nationally recognized test development criteria and  adequately assesses the \ncriteria in Sec.  1926.1427(j).      The requirements for test administration that apply under Option  (2) of \nthis section are set forth in Sec.  1926.1427(c)(2). These  requirements apply to both tests that have been \ndeveloped by an  accredited crane operator testing organization or to those that have  been approved by an \nauditor. Section 1926.1427(c)(2)(i) requires that  the auditor find that the procedures for administering the \ntest meet  nationally recognized test administration standards. This provision is  designed to ensure that the \ntest results accurately reflect the  operator's performance on the test.     Under Sec.  1926.1427(c)(2)(ii), \nthe auditor must be certified to  evaluate the administration of the written and practical tests by an  \naccredited crane operator testing organization. Section  1926.1427(c)(2)(iii) prohibits the auditor from being \nemployed by the  employer seeking the auditor's approval of its test administration  procedures.     \nProposed Sec.  1926.1427(c)(2)(iv) required that the audit be  conducted in accordance with nationally \nrecognized auditing standards.  OSHA noted that the proposed rule, as drafted by C-DAC, required only  that \nthe administration of the tests, and not the audit of the tests  themselves under paragraph (c)(1)(ii), would \nhave to be conducted in  accordance with nationally recognized auditing standards. OSHA  determines that \nthis was a drafting error and that the Committee  intended that the entire audit be conducted in accordance \nwith  nationally recognized auditing standards. Therefore, the Agency  solicited public comment on whether \na new Sec.",

(ID-0182.1; -0199.1; - 0172.1; -0341.) They were \nconcerned that the use of this term would  imply that anyone who serves in this role under Sec.  1926.1404 \nwould  be considered a supervisor under the National Labor Relations Act  (\"NLRA\").\\19\\ Their objections \nare rooted in the fact that the word  \"supervisor\" is used and defined in the NLRA. The commenters' o nly  \nobjection to Sec.  1926.1404(a) was the use of the term \"supervisor\";  they did not object to the actual duties \nor prerequisites spelled out  in the proposed rule applicable to this individual/team. Several  commenters \nsuggested that the word \"supervi sor\" be replaced with the  term \"designated individual\" and that the \nregulatory text be amended  to definitively indicate that OSHA has no intention of creating NLRA  \nimplications by use of the term. (ID-0182.1; -0199.1; -0172.1.) ---------------------------------------------------------------\n------------      \\19\\ 29 U.S.C. 159 -169 (1935).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \nThe use of \"supervisor\" in this rule would not be determinative  of supervisor status un der the NLRA. \\20\\ \nNonetheless, OSHA understands  the commenters' concerns that workers in the industry may be confused  \nby the use of this term. However, the term \"designated individual,\"  suggested by a labor representative and \nother commenters, could also  cause confusion, since it is ambiguous as to whether that person had  been \ngranted the authority to correct hazards. Such ambiguity in the  minds of the A/D crew members regarding \nthe authority of the A/D  supervisor would undermine the effectiveness of the provision itself. -------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------      \\20\\ With \"A/D s upervisor,\" OSHA was merely creating a  \ndescriptive term for use solely in the application of an OSHA  standard. OSHA's use of the term is a less \nsignificant designation  for the purposes of the NLRA than even a job title, which is itself  not determinative \nunder the NLRA. See, e.g., N.L.R.B. v. St. Mary's  Home, Inc., 690 F.2d 1062, 1066 (4th Cir. 1982) (\"As the [NLRB]  \nitself has put it, 'job titles are meaningless).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \nTherefore, OSHA has decided to use the term \"A/D director.\"  \"Director\" is not a defined term in the NLRA nor \ndoes it have any  particular significance as a job title with respect to NLRA  jurisprudence. Furthermore, like \n\"A/D supervisor,\" it is consistent  with C-DAC's intent to use a term that conveys the concept of authority  to \noversee the assembly/disassembly process. To remain consistent with  this new term, in Sec.  \n1926.1404(a)(1), OSHA has replaced the word  \"supervised\" with \"directed.\"      The A/D direct or has to \nmeet the definition of both a \"competent\"  and \"qualified\" person as OSHA defines those terms. \\21\\ The \nCommittee  determined that having an A/D director overseeing the assembly/ disassembly process who had \nboth the authority to correct a hazard a nd  who had the expertise of a qualified person was necessary to \nensure the  safety of the operation. Several commenters strongly endorsed the new  A/D director \nrequirement, believing the addition will improve workplace  safety. (See, e.g., ID-0343.) ----------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------      \\21\\ Section 1926.1401, Definitions, defines a \"competent  \nperson\" as: \"one who is capable of identifying existing and  predictable hazards in the surroundings or working \nconditions which  are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to employees, and who has  authorization to take \nprompt corrective measures to eliminate  them.\"",

The apprenticeship program  includes in-school training in a number of topics determined \nby the  Ministry of Education, a practical examination administered at  Ministry-designated sites, and a \nwritten examination administered by  the Ministry. Upon passing this examination and proving completion  \nof the requisite work hours, an apprentice receives a certificate of  qualification as one of three types of \nhoisting engineer from the  Ministry.

These candidates must sit \nfor the written examination and complete  the practical skills assessment required f or qualification of  \napprentices, but may demonstrate sufficient previous experience  instead of completing the number of \nwork/training hours required by  the apprenticeship program, to receive a certificate of  qualification from \nthe Ministry in one of the three hoisting  engineer categories.

A \nstudy of crane accidents in California both before and  after that State adopted a mandatory certification \nrequirement shows a  significant drop in crane -related fatalities an d injuries after the  certification \nrequirement went into effect on May 31, 2005. (ID - 0205.1.) For the three years prior to that date, California \nexperienced  ten fatal accidents, while in the next three years, only two fatal  accidents occurred. The \nnumber of injury cases declined from 30 to 13  over the same two periods. The California data supports that \nfrom  Ontario and demonstrates that significant safety benefits can be  expected from a requirement for \nthird-party certification.     The rulemaking record also contains substantial evidence regarding  the need \nfor continued application of State and local laws. As several  commenters explained, State and local licensing \nrequirements are backed  by the police power of that government. For example, New Yor k law  states that \nthe operation of a crane without a valid license in New  York City is a misdemeanor punishable by fines and \nimprisonment. (NYC  Administrative Code Sec. Sec.  28 -405.1; 28-203.1.) Moreover, states  have the power \nto revoke previously iss ued licenses under appropriate  circumstances. (ID -0171.1.) In contrast, OSHA's \nenforcement of  certification or other qualification requirements would be limited in  most cases to a citation \nto an employer. Based on the record as a  whole, the Agency conc ludes that cooperative Federal -State \nenforcement  will increase the effectiveness of the new standard. See also  discussion of federalism in \nsection V.D of this preamble.     The certification requirements in the final rule are therefore  designed to \nwork in conjunction with State and local laws, and to  afford employers several options for ensuring operator \nabilities in  areas where there are no State or local operator licensing  requirements. For operation of \nequipment within jurisdictions where a  State or locality licenses crane operators, and the government entity's  \nlicensing program meets certain criteria, OSHA is requiring operators  (with the exception of operators that \nare employees of and operating  equipment for the U.S. military) to be licensed by that government  entity. \nFor operation in other areas, employers will have three  options for certification or qualification of their \noperators. Each of  these options will be e xplained and discussed in detail below. They  are:     1. Be \ncertified by passing an examination administered by an  accredited testing organization.     2. Be qualified \nthrough the employer's in -house, but independently  audited, testing program.     3. Be qualified by the \nUnited States military.      While OSHA is requiring compliance with State and local licensing  laws \nimmediately upon the effective date of this standard in  recognition of the existing force and effect of those \nlaws, OSHA is not  requiring certification or qualification under the three options listed  above until four years \nfrom the effective date of this standard.  Moreover, there are limited exceptions to all of the licensing and",

That process is designed to  ensure that accredited testing organizations use a sufficiently  \nreliable process for certifying operators. The record also shows that  such a mechanism is an effective one for \ndetermining operator  competence (the record includes the support of the commenter and its C - DAC \nnominee for that mechanism). \\115\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\115\\ \nOSHA also notes that the this commenter is, in this  regard, taking a position that is inconsistent with the one \ntaken by  its C -DAC nominee, who had agreed to the C -DAC version of Sec.   1926.1427, which had no \nexperience/training prerequisite. Nor has  this commenter explained why it has changed its position from that  \nof its C -DAC nominee. Due to this inconsistency in position, OSHA  accords reduced weight to this \ncommenter's suggested change.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      There is \ninsufficient information in the record to include an  additional requirement for 1,000 hours of \"crane related \nexperience or  training.\" The commenter does not specify what should be included in  \"crane related \nexperience,\" or why 1,000 hours would be the  appropriate amount of such experience for this purpose. The \ncommenter  also does not specify if meeting the 1,000 hour prerequisite by  \"training\" should mean hands-\non (criteria for such training is  delineated in Sec.  1926.1427(f)) or classroom type training. OSHA  notes \nthat the other commenters supporting this section have not  recommended adding an experience or training \nprerequisite. The Agency  has therefore declined to accept this suggested change.\\116\\ ---------------------------\n------------------------------------------------      \\116\\ OSHA also notes that the commenter is, in this regard,  \ntaking a position that is inconsistent with the one taken by its C- DAC nominee, who had agreed to the C-DAC \nversion of Sec.  1926.1427,  which had no experience/training prerequisite.

Due to this inconsistency in position, \nOSHA accords reduced  weight to the commenter's suggested change. --------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------      Section 1926.1427(b)(1)(iii) requires that the testing organization  have procedures \nfor operators to re-apply and be re-tested in the event  an applicant fails a test. This would help ensure that if \nthe employee  initially failed to pass the test, the employee would be able to retake  the test and still have \nthe opportunity to obtain the certification.  Section 1926.1427(b)(1)(iii) also requires that the testing  \norganization have procedures for operators to re -apply and be re -tested  in the event an operator is \ndecertified.     Section 1926.1427(b)(1)(iv) specifies that the testing organization  must have procedures for \nre-certifying operators designed to ensure  that the operator continues to meet the requirements of Sec.   \n1926.1427(j). Under Sec.  1926.1427(b)(4), a certification is valid for  five years, after which the operator \nmust again pass a certification  examination. Section 1926.1427(b)(1)(iv) is included so that  recertification \nprocedures appropriate for those who have already been  certified will be available.      Under Sec.  \n1926.1427(b)(1)(v), the testing organization's  accreditation must be renewed by the accrediting organization \nat least  every three years to ensure continuing quality of testing materials and  administration.     No \ncomments were received on Sec. Sec.  1926.1427(b)(1)(iii) -(v);  those provisions are promulgated as \nproposed.     Under Sec.  1926.1427(b)(3) (previously design ated Sec.   1926.1427(b)(2) in the proposed \nrule), a certification is \"portable,\"  which means that a certificate issued under Option (1) would meet the  \nrequirements of Sec.  1926.1427(a)(2) (when State or local jurisdiction  does not require operator licensing) \nuntil the certificate expires. In  the final rule, OSHA is specifying that meaning directly in Sec.",

Snagging could damage the cables  or other equipment and result  in injury. This \nparagraph requires that  suspension ropes and pendants not be allowed to catch on the boom or  jib \nconnection pins or cotter pins (including keepers and locking  pins). The definition for pendants can be found \nin Sec.  1926.1401.  This definition is similar to that in the SC&RF Handbook, but with the  addition of the \nreference to \"bar type\" pendants. (See the discussion  of this provision at 73 FR 59746, Oct. 9, 20 08). No \ncomments were  received on this provision; it is promulgated as proposed.  Paragraph (h)(9) Struck by \nCounterweights     Final Sec.  1926.1404(h)(9) requires the A/D director to address  the potential for \nunintended movement from inadequately suppor ted  counterweights and from hoisting counterweights.",

OSHA received \nno  comments on the proposed provision and is def erring to the Committee's  determination. As noted in \nthe discussion of paragraph (a) above, the  requirement for the employer to comply with Sec.  1926.1425 \n(except for  Sec.  1926.1425(c)(3)) has been added to the provisions listed in  paragraph (a). The refore, \nOSHA is removing and reserving paragraph (g)  in this final rule because the requirements proposed in \nparagraph (g)  are now required in final paragraph (a).      According to paragraph (h) of this section, \nemployers must ensure  that equipment covered by this section is inspected pursuant to the  manufacturer's \nprocedures. The Committee concluded that these  inspections are sufficient to detect conditions that could \nlead to  equipment failure because manufacturers typically recommend procedures  designed to prevent \nhazards that can arise during equipment operation.  The Committee concluded that the comprehensive \ninspection procedures  required for higher-capacity equipment under Sec.  1926.1412 are not  needed for \nlighter, less complicated, equipment . OSHA received no  comments on the proposed paragraph and is \nadopting this paragraph in  the final rule as proposed based on the rationale provided by the  Committee.     \nParagraph (j) of this section prohibits using equipment covered by  this section to hoist personnel. OSHA \nreceived no comments on the  proposed paragraph and is including it in the final rule as proposed  because \nthe Committee determined that the low capacity and light  construction of this equipment makes it unsuited \nfor lifting personnel  safely.     Under paragraph (k) of this section, employers must ensure that a  qualified \nengineer designs the equipment. The Committee noted that some  employers may design and construct this \ntype of equipment themselves,  rather than using equipment built by a manufacturer. The Committee  \ndeveloped this provision to ensure that, in such cases, the design of  such equipment is sufficient to protect \nemployees exposed to it. OSHA  received no comments on the proposed paragraph and is retaining it in  the \nfinal standard as proposed based on the Committee's rationale.  Section 1926.1442 Severability      The \nAgency is including a standard severability clause to express  the Agency's intent that if any court of competent \njurisdiction renders  any provision in subpart CC unenforceable, the remaining provisions of  the subpart \nwould remain in effect.   V. Procedural Determinations   A. Legal Authority       The purpose  of the \nOccupational Safety and Health Act, 29 U.S.C.  651 et seq. (\"the Act\"), is \"to assure so far as possible every  \nworking man and woman in the Nation safe and healthful working  conditions and to preserve our human \nresources.\" 29 U.S.C. 651(b). To  achieve this goal, Congress authorized the Secretary of Labor to  promulgate \nand enforce occupational safety and health standards. See 29  U.S.C. 654, 655(b), and 658. A safety or health \nstandard \"requires  conditions, or the adoption or use of one or more practices, means,  methods, \noperations, or processes, reasonably necessary or appropriate  to provide safe or healthful employment and \nplaces of employment.\" 29  U.S.C. 652(8).     A safety standard is reasonably necessary or appropriate \nwithin the  meaning of 29 U.S.C. 652(8) if it substantially reduces or eliminates a  significant risk of material \nharm in the workplace; is economically and  technologically feasible; uses the most cost effective protective  \nmeasures; is consistent with or is a justified departure from prior  Agency action; is supported by substantial \nevidence; and is better able  to effectuate the Act's purposes than any relevant national consensus  standard. \nSee UAW v. OSHA, 37 F.3d 665, 668 (DC Cir. 1994)(\"LOTO\").  In addition, safe ty standards must be highly \nprotective. See id. at  669.     A standard is technologically feasible if the protective measures  it requires \nalready exist, can be brought into existence with available  technology, or can be created with technology that \ncan reasonably be  expected to be developed.

One commenter wanted the referenced consensus standards to be  included \nas an appendix for ease of compliance. (ID-0214.1.) Including  all the consensus standards relevant to this final \nrule would make the  regulatory text or an appendix cumbersome. Moreover, OSHA determines  that \nemployers using this equipment are likely to have ready access to  the pertinent standards referenced in \nparagraph (c)(1)(ii). For these  reasons, OSHA is not adding the full text of referenced consensus  standards \nto the regulatory text or an appendix. This paragraph is  promulgated as proposed.     Paragraph (c)(2) of \nthis section, Guy derricks, lists the  additional requirements applicable to the construction of guy derricks.  \n(See the preamble to the proposed rule for a short description of guy  derricks, 73 FR 59853, Oct. 9, 2008.)      \nParagraph (c)(2)(i) specifies the minimum number of guys to be six,  with equal spacing, except where a \nqualified person or derrick  manufacturer approves variations from these requirements and revises  the \nrated capacity to compensate for such variations. This requirement  is comparable to sec. 6 -1.2.2 of ANSI \nB30.6-1969 and ASME B30.6 -2003.  This paragraph is adopted as proposed.      Paragraph (c)(2)(ii) states \nthat guy derricks must not be used  unless the employer has the following guy information from a  \nmanufacturer or from a qualified person when not available from the  manufacturer: (A) The number of guys; \n(B) the spacing around the mast;  and (C) the size, grade, and construction of rope to be used for each  guy. \nParagraph (c)(2)(iii) requires that for guy derricks manufactured  after December 18, 1970, in addition to the \ninformation required by  Sec.  1926.1436(c)(2)(ii), the employer must h ave the following guy  information \nfrom a manufacturer or from a qualified person when not  available from the manufacturer: (A) The amount \nof initial sag or  tension; and (B) the amount of tension in guy line rope at anchor.     These provisions are \nsubstantially different from requirements in  the relevant ANSI/ASME standards. The corresponding \nANSI/ASME  provisions are sec. 6 -1.2.2 of ANSI B30.6 -1969 and ASME B30.6 -2003. The  ANSI/ASME \nstandards require the derrick manufacturer to furnish  complete information recommending the guy \nspecifications listed in  Sec. Sec.  1926.1436(c)(2)(ii) and (c)(2)(iii). \\136\\ The OSHA standard,  by contrast, \nimposes an obligation on derrick users to possess the  necessary information. No comments were received on \nthis deviation from  the consensus standard and OSHA has deferred to C-DAC's judgment that  it is better to \nplace this responsibility on the derrick user rather  than the manufacturer. ---------------------------------------------\n------------------------------      \\136\\ The 1969 version of the ANSI standard does not include the  pieces of \ninformation described in Sec.  1926.1436(c)(2)(iii), but  later versions of the B30.6 standard, incl uding the \n2003 version,  list those items.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      Paragraphs \n(c)(2)(ii) and (c)(2)(iii) have been revised from the  proposal. As proposed, these paragraphs simply required \nthe employ er to  have the listed pieces of information before using the guy derrick.  OSHA requested \ncomments on whether the standard should require guy  specifications to be developed by a qualified person \nif they are not  available from the manufacturer. Several comments were received  supporting the proposed \nrevision. (ID-0180.1; -0205.1; -0213.1.) No  comments were received that opposed this proposed revision. In \nthe  final rule the regulatory text in both paragraphs has been updated to  clarify that the required  \ninformation must come from the manufacturer  or from a qualified person when that information is not \navailable from  a manufacturer.     Paragraph (c)(2)(iv) states that the mast base must permit the mast  to \nrotate freely with allowance for slight tilting of the mast caused  by guy slack.",

The Committee  developed this provision to prevent cranes from being used to perform  operations \nbeyond their rated capacities. The Committee determined that  the load chart must be readily available to \ncrane operators since  capacity varies according to a variety of factors addressed in such  charts, including, \nfor example, boom length, radius, boom angle, and  equipment configuration. OSHA received no comments \non the proposed  paragraph and is including the provision in the final rule as proposed  based on the \nrationale provided by the Committee      Under paragraph (c)(3)(ii), employers must ensure that required  \nprocedures, recommendations, warnings, instructions, and operator's  manual be readily available for use by \nthe operator. Again, this  provision covers equipment with and without a cab. The consensus of the  \nCommittee was that operators must have easy access to the information  in these materials to operate the \nequipment safely. No comments were  received on this provision and OSHA is including this provision in the  \nfinal rule as proposed.     When rated capacities are available at the control station only in  electronic form \nand a failure occurs that makes the rated capacities  inaccessible, paragraph (c)(3)(iii) requires employers to \nensure that  the crane operator immediately ceases operations or follows safe shut-down  procedures until \nthe rated capacities become available again. The Committee  agreed that it is unsafe to continue to operate \nthe equipment if the rated  capacities are inaccessible to the operator. No comments were received  on this \nprovision and OSHA is adopting this requirement in the final  rule as proposed.      Paragraph (d) of this \nsection specifies requirements for safety  devices and operational aids for the equipm ent. In this regard,  \nparagraph (d)(1) requires that employers maintain safety devices and  operational aids that are part of the \noriginal equipment in accordance  with manufacturer procedures. (Note: This requirement applies to anti  \ntwo-block devices used on equipment covered by this section  manufactured before the effective date of this \nfinal standard; see  discussion of anti two -block device under paragraph (d)(3) below.) The  Committee \ndetermined that the full range of safety devices and  operational aids required by Sec. Sec.  1926.1415 and \n1926.1416 of this  subpart were not generally needed for the safe operation of this low- capacity equipment. \nHowever, the Committee also concluded that, if the  manufacturer included such devices or aids, it is probable \nthat the  manufacturer's design relies on them working properly for the equipment  to operate safely. \nTherefore, it is appropriate for the standard to  require them to be maintained in accordance with the \nmanufacturer's  procedures. No comments were received on this provision and OSHA is  retaining this \nparagraph in the final standard as proposed.      Under paragraph (d)(2), employers must ensure that the  \nequipment  covered by this section and manufactured more than one year after the  effective date of this \nfinal standard be equipped either with an anti - two block device that meets the requirements of Sec.  \n1926.1416(d)(3),  or be designed so that no dama ge or load failure occurs in the event of  a two -block \nsituation. The provision also identifies an example of  equipment designed to prevent equipment damage load \nfailure, i.e., when  the power unit of the machine stalls in the event of a two-block  situation. In such a case, \nthe power unit does not have sufficient  power to cause the load to fail or to damage the equipment. Instead,  \nwhen the two-block situation occurs, the power unit stalls, which  prevents the load from falling. The purpose \nof this paragraph is to  prevent equipment damage or failure stemming from contact between a  component \non the hoist line and the boom tip, which occurs during a  two-block situation. Such contact can lead to a \ndamaged or severed load  line, as well as other types of e quipment failure.     The Committee agreed to \nprovide employers with discretion to choose  between two options for eliminating two -block hazards. The \nfirst option  prevents a two -block situation from occurring, while the second option  prevents equipment \ndamage and load failure if a two-block situation  occurs. The Committee determined that, for the equipment",

Boom \nstops on luffing boom type tower cranes (Sec.   1926.1435(d)(2)(i)) and jib stops on luffing boom type tower \ncranes if  equipped with a jib attachment (Sec.  1926.1435(d)(2)(ii)) are  required. These are comparable to \nthe boom and jib stops required for  other cranes under Sec.  1926.1415 (discussed above) and are intended  \nto prevent the boom and jib from being raised to too high an angle and  toppling over backwards.      \nParagraph (d)(2)(iii) requires travel end rail stops at both ends  of the travel rail. These are comparable to the \nrail stops required for  equipment on rails under Sec.  1926.1415 and are designed to keep the  crane from \novershooting the boundaries on the rail within which it is  supposed to operate, which could cause the crane \nto collapse.     Paragraph (d)(2)(iv) requires travel rail clamps on all travel  bogies. A \"travel bogie (tower \ncranes)\" is defined in Sec.  1926.1401  as \"an assembly of two or more axles arranged to permit vertical \nwheel  displacement and equalize the loading on the wheels.\" When tower  cranes travel on rails, they are \nmounted on tr avel bogies. The rail  clamps that are required by this paragraph enable the bogies to be  \nclamped to the rail to prevent the crane from lifting off the rail.      Paragraph (d)(2)(v) requires integrally \nmounted check valves on all  load supporting hydraulic cylinders. A check valve permits fluid to  flow in one \ndirection only. When installed on load supporting hydraulic  cylinders, such as the cylinders used to climb the \ncrane, they protect  against the loss of load support in the event of a hydraulic pressure failure  by preventing \nthe reverse flow of the hydraulic fluid supporting the cylinder.      Paragraph (d)(2)(vi) requires a hydraulic \nsystem pressure limiting  device.     A pressure limiting device, such as a relief valve, would prevent  the \npressure in a hydraulic system from exceeding its design limit,  which can cause the system to fail.      \nParagraph (d)(2)(vii) requires the following brakes, which must  automatically set in the event of pressure loss \nor power failure: A  hoist brake on all hoists; a swing brake; a trolley brake; and a rail  travel brake. These \ntypes of brakes are needed to enable the motion of  the crane and load to be controlled safely. Under this \nparagraph, they  must set automatically to avoid uncontrolled movement of the crane or  load in the event \nof pressure loss or power failure that prevents their  operation.     Paragraph (d)(2)(viii) req uires a \n\"deadman\" control or forced  neutral return control (hand) levers. These devices ensure that the  crane does \nnot move unless the movement is being controlled by the  operator. In the case of a deadman control, the \nmotion being  controlled, such as hoisting or trolleying, ceases when the operator  releases the control. \nForced neutral return control levers  automatically return to the neutral position when they are released.      \nParagraph (d)(2)(ix) requires an emergency stop switch at the  operator's station. This safety device is needed \nto enable the operator  to immediately stop all crane functions in the event of an emergency.     Paragraph \n(d)(2)(x) requires trolley end stops as safety devices  because trolley travel limiting devices, which are required \nby Sec.   1926.1435(e)(5)(i), will not work without trolley end stops.     Paragraph (d)(3) requires that all of \nthe safety devices listed in  Sec.  1926.1435(d)(2) be in proper working order for the crane to be  operated. \nWhere a device stops working properly during operations, the  operator would have to safely stop operations, \nand operations are  prohibited from resuming until the device is once again in proper  working order. In the \nfinal rule, OSHA is adding text and a cross- reference to Sec.",

OSHA has carefully considered the comments asking for additional  types of \nequipment to be exempted from the qualification/certification  requirements of Sec.  1926.1427. For the \nfollowing reasons, OSHA  declines to add such exemptions to the final rule.     The members of C-DAC, who \nhad vast collective experience in all  aspects of crane operations, reached a consensus that third -party  \nverification was needed to reduce the number of crane accidents and  fatalities in the construction industry. \nThey further determined that  such a requirement should apply to virtually all hoisting equipment,  with only \nthe limited exceptions listed in the proposed rule. In  proposing to exempt equipment with a rated capacity of \n2,000 pounds or  less, the Committee considered whether to establish a higher threshold  for the \nrequirement but concluded that the operators of higher-capacity  cranes, including those in the 5,000-35,000 \npound range that the  commenters ask to be exempted, needed to be well-qualified to reduce  the number",

Subpart N  incorporated similar load chart requirements via sec. 6-1.1.2 in ANSI  B30.6-1969, which \nremains the same in the 2003 version of the consensus  standard.     Paragraph (b)(2)(i) requires the load \nchart contain the rated  capacity at corresponding ranges of boom angle or operating radii. This  information \nis necessary to prevent overloading of the derrick.      Paragraph (b)(2)(ii) requires the load chart to list the \nspecific  lengths of components to which the rated capacities apply. This  information is necessary because \nthe derrick's load capacity vari es  with different component lengths.      Paragraph (b)(2)(iii) requires the \nload chart to list required  parts for hoist reeving. By listing the reeving parts considered during  the \ntabulation of available load charts, the derrick operator can  determine if available load charts are applicable \nto the configuration  of the derrick at the work site. As with paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii),  meeting the \nrequirement of paragraph (b)(2)( iii) will help prevent  accidents that could occur as a result of errors in \ndetermining the  equipment's rated capacity.     Paragraph (b)(2)(iv) requires the size and construction of \nrope to  be included on the load chart or in the operating manual. This  requirement prevents hoisting \naccidents that might occur if a rope  fails because it was the wrong size or construction for the load being  \nlifted.     Paragraph (b)(3) of this section, Load chart location, sets forth  the requirement for the location \nof load charts. Section  1926.1436(b)(3)(i), Permanent installations, requires permanently  installed derricks \nwith fixed lengths of boom, guy, and mast, to have a  load chart posted where it is visible to personnel \nresponsible for the  operation of the equipment. Section 1926.1436(b)(3)(ii), Non-permanent  installations, \nrequires derricks that are not permanently installed to  have the load chart readily available at the job site to \npersonnel  responsible for the operation of the equipment. These requirements   ensure the critical \ninformation contained on these charts is readily  available on the worksite enabling the calculation of the \nparameters  for a safe lift. No comments were received for Sec.  1926.1436(b); it  is promulgated as \nproposed. Paragraph (c)--Construction     Paragraph (c) of this section contains supplemental engineering \nand  fabrication requirements that address hazards specific to derricks.  Paragraph (c)(1), General \nrequirements, lists general construction  requirements that apply to the use of all types of derricks. These  \nrequirements are similar to sec. 6 -1.2.1 of ANSI B30.6 -1969 and ASME  B30.6-2003 and would help the \nemployer prevent accidents caused by  inadequate structural design and fabrication.     Paragraph (c)(1)(i) \nstates that derricks must be constructed to  meet all stresses imposed on members and components when \ninstalled and  operated in accordance with the manufacturer's/buil der's procedures and  within its rated \ncapacity. \"Builder\" is defined in Sec.  1926.1401 as  \"the builder/constructor of equipment.\" This definition \ndistinguishes  a \"builder\" of equipment (a derrick that is erected at the worksite  by an employer) from a \nmanufacturer, who sells products that may be  used at any worksite. Section 1926.1436(c)(1)(i) uses the word  \n\"builder\" in addition to \"manufacturer\" because it will often be  the builder's procedures, rather than the \nmanufacturer's, that must be  followed to ensure that derricks are constructed properly. In the  proposed \nrule, the definition of builder included the word employer.  Upon review of the definition proposed, OSHA \ndetermines that the word  employer did not enhance the definition and could possib ly lead to confusion.  \nTherefore, OSHA has modified the definition in the final rule.",

Impact of the Final Rule on Small Entities     OSHA has analyzed \nthe potential impact of the final standard on  small entities. The total annual cost of compliance with the final \nfor  small entities is estimated  to be $101 million, as shown by industry in  Table B-13. The costs per \nestablishment in the table are identical in  several sectors because the cost model assumed that, on average, \nthe  number of cranes, operators, and crane jobs were the same for each  affected establishment. In the \ncrane-rental sectors, the Agency had  rental income data for each sector and estimated the number of cranes  \nowned per establishment for each sector. Different sizes of firms with  different numbers of cranes in the \nrental sectors resulted in per  establishment (average) costs varying by industry NAICS.

When the  arc results from a source other than a power line, the extent of the  \ndamage will vary, and the inspector must determine whether the rope is  damaged to the extent that repair \nor replacement is necessary.     If a power line arcs to a wire rope, there will usually be  sufficient localized \nburn damage that the rope must be removed from  service. However, a wire rope may make electrical contact \nwith a power  line and leave no visible damage. For example, if the load contacts a  power line and is not \ninsulated from the wire rope, a large current can  flow through the rope. The current may be large enough to \ndamage the  internal structure of the rope and weaken it without leaving any  visible evidence on the rope \nitself that this has happened. There is no  realistic way to assess the internal damage that such electrical  \ncontact has caused to the wire rope. Therefore, C-DAC determined that  any wire rope that came into electrical \ncontact with a power line must  be removed from service.     Only one comment was submitted regarding \nproposed paragraph (a)(2).  The commenter suggested adding two additional conditions to the list of  \nCategory II deficiencies. (ID-0121.1.) The first is where one outer  wire is broken at the point of contact with \nthe core of the rope and  protrudes or loops out from the rope structure. The second is where one  outer \nwire is broken at the strand to strand contact point and is  raised up from the body of the rope or looped out \nof the rope  structure.     OSHA disagrees with the commenter because this commenter did not  offer any \nrationale to justify these additional provisions. Therefore,  OSHA is deferring to the expertise of th e \nCommittee. Section  1926.1413(a)(2) is promulgated as proposed except for the  clarifications noted above.     \nA \"running wire rope\" is a wire rope that moves over sheaves or  drums. This definition is included in Sec.  \n1926.1401 of this final  rule to m ake clear the nature of the wire rope that is subject to this  inspection \nprovision. These criteria are the same as those contained in  sec. 5-2.4.3 of ASME B30.5-2004, and those for \nrunning wire ropes and  pendant or standing wire ropes are also contained in sec. 5 -2.4.2 of  ANSI B30.5-\n1968, which is incorporated by reference in subpart N. One  issue that was left unanswered during the \nCommittee discussions is  whether these broken wire criteria are equally applicable when using  plastic \nsheaves. The Agency requested public comment on this issue.  However, no comments were received. OSHA \nnotes that the proposed broken  wire criteria did no t depend on the type of sheave involved and would  \ntherefore include plastic as well as metal sheaves. Since the paragraph  is being promulgated as proposed, the \ncriteria apply regardless of the  material of which the sheave is made. Paragraph (a)(3) Critical Review Items     \nUnder paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the competent person must  give particular attention to certain \"Critical \nReview Items\" during  the shift inspection (as well as, as discussed below, in the monthly  and annual \ninspections). Proposed paragraph (a)(3)(iii) listed, among  the critical review items, \"wire rope at flange points, \n[and]  crossover points.\" These terms were defined in proposed Sec.   1926.1401, Definitions.     One \ncommenter suggested that each wrap of the rope is a crossover  point such that the crossover points will line \nup across the face of  the drum. (ID-0121.) The Agency disagrees with this view. As defined in  the standard, \na crossover point occurs \"where one layer of rope climbs  up and crosses over the previous layer * * *.\" While \nthe rope climbs  up at the drum's flange, it does not climb up as it then spools across  the previous (lower) \nlayer towards the other flange, i.e., as it wraps  across the face of the drum.     In the proposed rule, OSHA \nnoted that the i tems listed in  Sec. Sec.",
    "edab1e9a-160f-4b43-8a93-12382ccd4e95": "page_label: 219\nfile_name: OSHA-Final Rule-Cleaned.pdf\nfile_path: C:\\Users\\bs44876\\Desktop\\Project\\CII-Crane\\FineEmb\\dataset\\data\\OSHA-Final Rule-Cleaned.pdf\nfile_type: application/pdf\nfile_size: 3496317\ncreation_date: 2025-01-07\nlast_modified_date: 2025-01-07\n\nthis  section is the Committee's concern that, at present, the operator's  employer has no ready means of \ndetermining if the signal person (who is  typically a different employer's employee) has the necessary \nknowledge  and skill for signaling until after hoisting operations have begun. In  other words, a problem with \nthe signal person's ability may not become  evident to an operator until a hazardous situation has already \narisen.  Requiring documentation enables this determination to be made before  hoisting operations begin.     \nRequiring documentation under Option (2) of this section addresses  C-DAC's concern. Therefore, in the \nproposed rule, OSHA expanded the  first sentence of the C -DAC version of Sec.  1926.1428(a)(2) to clarify  \nthat documentation is required under Option (2). The only comment  received on OSHA's inclusion of an \nexplicit requirement for  documentation under Option (2) was from SC&RA, which supported its  inclusion. \n(ID-0205.1.) Therefore, in the final rule, documentation is  required under Option (2).      The Agency \nconcludes that the rationale for including an explicit  requirement for documentation under Option (2) of this \nsection--the  need for other affected employers at the site, such as the operator's  employer, to have a ready \nmeans of determining if the signal person has  the necessary knowledge and skill before beginning hoisting  \noperations--also necessitates that the documentation be available at  the site. OSHA is concerned that if it is \nnot available at the site  (either in paper form or electronically), it is less likely that the  documentation will \nserve its intended purpose. Therefore, in the final  rule, the documentation required under both Option (1) \nand Option (2)  of this section must be available at the site.      OSHA is also adding a requirement in \nparagraph (a)(3) of this  section of the final rule that the documentation must specify each type  of signaling \nfor which the signalperson has been tested and meets the  requirements of Sec.  1926.1428(c). This \nrequirement parallels the  requirement in Sec.  1926.1427(b)(2) in which operator certification  documents \nmust specify the type and capacity of the equipment for which  an operator is certified. This new provision \nfills a potential  communication gap that would have existed in the implementation of the  rule as proposed. \nAs explained above, one of the main reasons that OSHA  is requiring the documentation to be available at the \nsite is so that  the operator, or any person on the job site, who is unfamiliar with a  signal person may review \nthat documentation to ensure that the signal  person is sufficiently qualified to provide the signals required \nfor  that job. Because many of the qualifications that must be tested under  paragraph (c) of this section are \nconditional (e.g., if hand signals  are to be used, the signal person must understand the Standard Method  \nhand signals), and the proposed rule did not specify any content for  the documentation, the documentation \nprovided by a third-party  qualified evaluator under Option (1) of this sectio n might simply have  generally \nnoted the satisfactory completion of testing in accordance  with Sec.  1926.1428(c). In that case, under the \nproposed rule, an  operator preparing for a job requiring the use of hand signals would  not have been able \nto use t hat documentation as intended to determine  whether the signalperson knew and understood the \nStandard Method for  hand signals. Under the final rule, the operator will be able to make  that \ndetermination quickly because the documentation must specify  whether the signalperson was examined on \nhand signals. This requirement  is not intended to require significant detail, such as specifying that  the \nsignalperson knows the hand signals for \"hoist\" or \"stop.\"  Rather, it is intended to identify satisfactory \ncompletion of testing  on different categories of signals, such as hand signals, radio  signals, or flag signals.     \nParagraph (b) of this section addresses circumstances in which a  signal person who had been qualified under \nSec.  1926.1428(a)  subsequently acts in a manner that indicates that he or she may not  meet the \nqualification requirements. Such an indication would result,  for example, where the use of Standard Method \nsignals have been agreed  to but the signal person does not give a Standard Method signal.  Another example",

This requirement will allow all  employees \naffected by the operation of the equipment to be notified of  any outstanding repairs or adjustments, and \nprovides them with  information about alternative measures implemented by the employer.  Affected \nemployees are any employees exposed to equipment-related  hazards; such employees include, but are not \nlimited to, any employee  in the fall zone of the load, signal persons, riggers, operators, load  handlers, and \nlift directors. OSHA concludes that this provision is  necessary to allow employees to adjust their work \npractices following  implementation of the alternative measures.     The Agency finds this modification to \nbe consistent with the  requirements throughout this subpart with respect to sharing  information about \nequipment-related hazards. This added provision  merely requires employers to take the information acquired \nunder Sec.   1926.1417(j)(1) and distribute it to affected employees. Employers may  distribute this \ninformation by any effective means available. Paragraph (k)     This paragraph prohibits safety devices and \noperational aids from  being used as a substitute for the exercise of professional judgment by  the operator. \nSuch devices and aids do not displace the need for  operators to apply their professional judgment because \nthe devices and  aids can malfunction and lead to the types of safety hazards they are  designed to prevent. \nNo comments were submitted on this paragraph;  therefore it is promulgated as proposed.  Paragraph (l) \n[Reserved.] Paragraph (m)     If the competent person determines that there is a slack rope  condition \nrequiring re-spooling of the rope, this paragraph requires  that before starting the lift, it must be verified that \nthe rope is  seated on the drum and in the sheaves as the slack is removed. This  will prevent a loose coil of \nrope from becoming cross-coiled on the  drum, a portion of the rope coming off the drum altogether, or the \nrope  being pulled alongside (instead of seating in) a sheave. Each of these  conditions can lead to sudden \nfailure of the rope. No comments were  submitted on this paragraph; therefore it is promulgated as proposed. \nParagraph (n)      This paragraph requires the competent person to adjust the  equipment and/or \noperations to address the hazards posed by wind, ice  and snow on equipment capacity and stability. In the \nproposed rule, the  person would have been required to \"consider the effect\" of those  elements, but OSHA \nis clarifying in the final rule that the competent  person must actually take steps such as re-calculating a lower \nload  capacity, stabilizing the equipment, or even postponing a lift. Wind  can reduce capacity by imposing \nloads on the equipment, which can also  reduce stability. Ice and snow can also reduce capacity and stability  \nwhen it accumulates on the equipment. There are numerous variables  involved in determining the effects of \nwind, ice and snow in any  particular circumstance, (for example, the extent to which the crane is  operating \nbelow its rated capacity, the sail effect presented by the  load, the rate at which ice or snow is accumulating, \nand whether the  snow is wet or light). No comments were submitted on this paragraph;  therefore it is \npromulgated as proposed with the one change noted  above. Paragraph (o) Compliance With Rated Capacity     \nSection 1926.1417(o)(1) requires employers to ensure that equipment  is not operated beyond its rated \ncapacity. Overloading a crane or  derrick can cause it to collapse, with potentially catastrophic  consequences. \nThis basic safeguard has long been recognized in the  industry as crucial and is designed to prevent such \naccidents. (See  additional discussion at 73 FR 59792, Oct. 9, 2008).      Section 1926.1417(o)(2) requires \nemployers to ensure that operators  are not required to operate the equipment in a manner that would \nexceed  its rated capacity, in violation of Sec.  1926.1417(o)(1) above. This  provision reinforces the general \nprohibition of Sec.  1926.1417(o)(1)  by making it a separate violation for an employer to expressly require  \nan operator to exceed the equipment's rated capacity. It is designed to  avoid a situation where an employer",

However, if the employer documents \nthat it  has ordered the necessary parts within 7 days of the occurrence of the  deficiency, the repair must \nbe completed within 7 days of receipt of  the parts.     OSHA noted in the proposed rule preamble that the \nterm \"days\"  could mean either business days or calendar days. For the reasons  outlined in the discussion \nof Sec.  1926.1416 above, in the final rule  OSHA has changed \"days\" to \"calendar days\" to reflect the  \nCommittee's intent.

For example, one item that must be inspected is  \ncontrol mechanisms for maladjustments that interfere with proper  operation. During the shift, such \nmaladjustments may be easier to  detect than a check conducted before the equipment is operating. Still  \nothers may change during the shift and require additional inspection.  For example, if the crane is moved to a \nnew location during the shift,  it would be necessary to inspect the ground conditions in that  location.     \nRegarding the frequency of this inspection, an energy utility  representative commented that the per -shift \ncrane inspection fails to  take into account the frequency or severity of use. (ID -0203.1.) The  commenter \npoints out that if a crane is used once during the first  shift, and once during the second shift, even if only to \nlift a minor  load, the inspection would have to be conducted  twice. The commenter  agrees that the per \nshift inspection may be valuable and necessary on  constructions sites where cranes are used continuously for \nheavy use,  but states that the level of inspection should be adjusted to reflect  the infrequent use of mobile \ncranes for construction activities at  operating generating plants. The commenter suggests that the final  \nstandard should permit employers to use the inspection protocol in ASME  B30.5, sec. 5-2.     OSHA does \nnot agree that minimal use during one shift negates the  need for a shift inspection during the next shift. Since \nthe completion  of the last shift inspection, the equipment could have developed a  deficiency or been \ndamaged even if it was used to hoist one load. For  example, fluids may expand or freeze, seals may leak due \nto a change in  temperature, structural materials may crack, or electrical components  may fail. A deficiency \nthat might not have been apparent earlier might  become more readily observable.      Moreover, while \nsome equipment may be used infrequently for  construction work, the commenter did not disagree that it \nmay be used  heavily for other purposes. When a crack, leak, or other hazard  appears, and the equipment \nis to be used in construction, the source of  that hazard is immaterial; the fact that the problem may have \ndeveloped  during non-construction uses does nothing to reduce the safety hazard  that would be posed by \nthe use of that equipment in construction.  Instead, the multiple uses of some of this equipment, potentially \nby  different employees using it for different purposes, makes it all the  more likely that important \ninformation might not be shared in a timely  manner, and therefore more important to ensure that the \nequipment is  inspected during each shift of construction work. An employer cannot  assume that the \ncondition of the equipment has not changed since the  completion of the last shift inspection, even if the \nemployer did not  use the equipment extensively during that shift. OSHA is convinced that  it is reasonable, \nand not overly burdensome, to require a competent  person to complete this inspection of the equipment \nbefore or during  each shift to ensure it is safe for use.     A competent person is required to perform the \nshift inspection. A  labor management association commented that OSHA should replace  \"competent \nperson\" with \"operator\" for the purposes of who should  perform the visual inspection r equired by Sec.  \n1926.1412(d). (ID - 0172.) As explained in the preamble to the proposed rule, OSHA  anticipates that the \nemployer will often use the equipment operator as  the competent person who conducts the shift inspection. \nThe operator,  in most cases, by virtue of his or her qualification or certification  under Sec. Sec.  1926.1427 \nand 1926.1430, experience, and familiarity  with the equipment, is a competent person. However, the \nemployer has  the flexibility to use someone else to conduct the shift inspection as  long as that person is a \ncompetent person. When the operator does not  qualify as a competent person, the employer is required to \nchoose a  different person. For these reasons, in the final rule, OSHA is  retaining the requirement that a \ncompetent person conduct the shift  inspection.     A local government requested that the standard require \nthe employer  to document the completion and results of the shift inspection. (ID - 0156.1.) In addition, it",

OSHA agrees. Paragraph (b) of this \nsection therefore  provides that maintenance and repair personnel must meet the definition  of a qualified \nperson with respect to the equipment and maintenance/  repair tasks they perform. As defined in Sec.  \n1926.1401, a \"qualified  person\" is \"a pers on who, by possession of a recognized degree,  certificate, or \nprofessional standing, or who by extensive knowledge,  training, and experience, successfully demonstrated \nthe ability to  solve/resolve problems relating to the subject matter, the work, or th e  project.\"     Two \ncommenters requested that maintenance and repair workers be  certified by a third party. (ID-0061; -0156.1.) \nAs noted in the  preamble to the proposed rule and again here, C -DAC considered the  requirements for \nmaintenance and repair workers and found that the term  \"qualified person\" would adequately address these \nconcerns. OSHA  agrees, and is promulgating paragraph (b) without  substantive change.  OSHA is \nsubstituting the word \"must\" for \"shall\" in the last  sentence of that paragraph to avoid any implication that a \nmaintenance  and repair worker is, by definition, a qualified person. Section 1926.1430 Training     With a \nfew exceptions, the requirements in this final rule for this  section are the same as those in the proposed rule \n(see 73 FR 59939,  Oct. 9, 2008). This section both references training criteria required  by other sections of \nsubpart CC and sets forth additional  training  criteria and requirements. Additionally, Sec.  1926.1430(h) \nrequires  employers to evaluate employees' understanding of the training.     The Agency determined that \nboth training and testing of certain  employees are critical to the safety of cr ane/derrick use in  \nconstruction.\\125\\ The requirements of this section and subpart with  respect to training do not replace those \nestablished by Sec.  1926.21,  Safety training and education, which requires the employer to (1)  \"establish \nand supervise pr ograms for the education and training of  employers and employees in the recognition, \navoidance and prevention of  unsafe conditions in employments covered by the [OSH] Act,\" and (2)  \"instruct \neach employee in the recognition and avoidance of unsafe  conditions and the regulations applicable to his \nwork environment to  control or eliminate any hazards or other exposure to illness or  injury.\" Instead, they \nsupplement and clarify the general training  requirements for particular conditions and activities. T hese \nspecific  provisions ensure that employees have the necessary knowledge and skill  to work safely with and \naround cranes. Greater specificity highlights  the particular tasks (and the hazards associated with them) for \nwhich  certain types of training are necessary.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \n\\125\\ With respect to operator testing, as discussed in  connection with Sec.  1926.1427, Operator \nqualification and  certification, this standard places special emphasis on ensuring  that equipment operators \nhave acquired the knowledge and skills  necessary to operate their equipment safely. This standard also  \nincludes specific assessment requirements for signal persons (see  Sec.  1926.1428(a)).  ---------------------------\n------------------------------------------------      The Agency is also clarifying in Sec.  1926.1430 that employers  \nhave a duty to train each e mployee covered by subpart CC, and to  provide that training at no cost to the \nemployee. In the introductory  text to proposed Sec.  1926.1430, the Agency specified that the  employer \n\"shall provide\" all applicable training, which was included  to indicate that the employer would bear the cost \nof training. This is  consistent with the Agency's treatment of training costs in the  preliminary economic \nanalysis provided in the preamble for the proposed  rule. (See, e.g., 73 FR 59895, Oct. 9, 2008 (operator \ncertification  training treated as cost to employer).) In the final rule, OSHA is  rewording each of the training \nrequirements to further clarify the  employer's responsibilities with respect to all training requirements  \nunder subpart CC, and is adding new S ec.  1926.1430(g)(3) to expressly  state that employers must provide",

The second sentence of Sec.  1910.12(a), b y providing that  each employer must \nprotect the employment and the places of employment  of each of his employees, does not negate the broad \nreach of the first  sentence. The Secretary did not include language to indicate that an  employer has \nobligations only toward his employees and the worksites of  his employees.     Furthermore, the history of \nSec.  1910.12(a) reveals that the  Secretary did not intend for it to limit her authority. Indeed, Sec.   \n1910.12(a) is located within a subpart entitled \"Adopt ion and  Extension of Federal Standards,\" which the \nSecretary created to extend  her jurisdiction through the adoption of the Construction Safety Act's  standards. \nSec.  1910.11(a), subpart B. The opening paragraph of  subpart B states that the subpart's provisions \"adopt \nand extend the  applicability of established Federal standards * * * with respect to  every employer, \nemployee, and employment covered by the Act.\" Sec.   1910.11(a). Thus, neither the language nor the \ncontext of Sec.   1910.12(a) suggest a conflict with the requirement that electric  utilities provide voltage \ninformation when employers request it.     The commenter also cites United States v. MYR Group, Inc., in \nwhich  the Seventh Circuit held that OSHA could not cite a parent corporation  for the failure of a subsidiary \nto train its employees. 361 F.3d 364  (7th Cir. 2004). Yet the court distinguished the facts of that case  from \ncircumstances where \"[e]ach employer at the worksite controls a  part of the dangerous activities occurring \nat the site and is the  logical person to be made responsible for protecting everyone at the  site from the \ndangers that are within his power to control.\" Id. at  367. Consistent with the Seventh Circuit's reasoning, \nOSHA has placed  on utilities the responsibility to inform construction workers about  power line voltage, as \nelectric utilities are in the best position to  disseminate voltage information.     In summary, OSHA has \nfirmly-established precedent, under part 1926  and beyond, for requiring that an employer with special \nknowledge of  occupational hazards provide information to protect workers. Like the  provisions of the \nHazard Communication Standard and th e Asbestos  Standard for the Construction Industry, Sec.  \n1926.1407(e) imposes  requirements on employers who possess essential information and are in  the best \nposition to distribute it.      The Committee determined that two business days would be a  reasonable \namount of time to allow the utility owners/operator to  respond and be sufficiently short to be useful to the",

(ID-0286.1.) This commenter  recommended that OSHA \navoid this perceived notice problem by limiting  the scope of the standard to equipment described in ASME \nB30 standards.  It recommended adding the words \"and is described in American Society  of Mechanical \nEngineers ASME B30 standards\" at the end of the first  sentence of proposed paragraph (a) of this  section.     \nOSHA disagrees with this commenter that paragraph (a), when read  together with the list of exclusions in \nparagraph (c) of this section,  does not provide clear notice as to what equipment is covered and what  is \nexcluded. As explained earlier, paragraph (a) is designed to make  clear the types of existing equipment that \nare covered while also  covering newly-developed equipment that is similar to the listed  examples. The \napproach suggested by the commenter would limit any  coverage of newly developed equipment to any such \nequipment that might  be included in an unspecified future ASME B30 standard, without the  opportunity \nfor OSHA to assess that equipment to determine whether its  exemption from subpart CC would be \nappropriate. OSHA concludes that  this approach may unduly limit the scope of subpart CC. In addition, it  \nwould contradict the intent of C -DAC with respect to several specific  types of equipment. For example, at \nleast three types of covered equipment  that meet the functional definition in paragraph (a), dedicated pile \ndrivers,\\4\\  digger derricks (see the discussion of digger derricks below under  paragraph (c)(4)), and straddle \ncranes are not covered in ASME B30 standards,  while the ASME B30 standards include equipment (e.g., \nstacker cranes) not  covered under this standard. Thus, adopting the commenter's suggestion would  exclude \ncertain equipment that C-DAC intended to include and would  introduce ambiguity over whether certain types \nof equipment that C -DAC  intended to exclude are included. Where the commenter has not made a  \ncompelling argument as to why the standard would be improved by  adopting the ASME standards, OSHA \ndefers to C-DAC's expertise on this  issue. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\4\\ \nThe proposed rule explained in detail why C -DAC decided to  include dedicated pile drivers under this rule \neven though they are  not traditionally considered to be cranes or derricks (see 73 FR  59727, Oct. 9, 2008). \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------      A commenter objected to defining the scope \nof the standard in terms  of types of equipment, saying that it represented an unexplained  departure from \nOSHA's practice of describing the scope of construction  standards in terms of conditions and practices. (ID-\n0203.1.) Contrary  to this commenter's belief, OSHA has often defined construction  standards in terms of \nequipment. See, e.g., subpart L, \"Scaffolds.\"  Indeed, this rule for cranes and derricks replaces a previous rule \nfor  cranes and derricks at former Sec.  1926.550, the scope of which was  also defined in terms of types of \nequipment.     Several commenters asked OSHA to clarify the meaning of  \"construction\" as it is used in \nparagraph (a) of this section. (ID- 0147.1; -0165.1; -0214.1; -0235.1.) Some of these comments asked OSHA  to \nclarify whether the use of lifting equipment to deliver materials to  a construction site is covered under the \nstandard. That issue is  addressed below and is clarified in a new Sec.  1926.1400( c)(17). One  commenter \nnoted that OSHA draws a distinction between construction work  and routine maintenance and asked for \nexamples of activities that fall  under \"construction\" and under \"maintenance.\" (ID -0147.1.) OSHA  notes \nthat considerable guidance on this distinction is already  available. Several interpretive documents that discuss \nthe distinction  between construction and maintenance in the context of specific  inquiries and issues are \navailable on OSHA's Web site.",

(ID-0333.2.) This  party \nsuggested that the rule make clear that fall protection should  never be anchored to the load line when the \nload is unattended.     OSHA disagrees. In fact, the intent of Sec.  1926.1423(j) is to  allow an employee's \npersonal fall arrest system to be anchored to the  load line only when there is no load suspended from the \nline. This is  implicit in the requirement of paragraph (j)(1) that the qualified  person determine that the set-\nup and rated capacity (including the  hook, load line, and rigging) meets or exceeds the requirements of  Sec.  \n1926.502(d)(15). If it were permissible for there to be a suspended  load, the parenthetical would include the \nword \"load,\" for the weight of  any load would certainly affect the ability of the hook or load line to  serve as \na fall protection anchorage. To make the rule's intent clear, OSHA  is adding paragraph (j)(3), which states that \nno load may be suspended  from the load line, as an additional condition that must be met when  anchoring \na personal fall arrest system to the hook or load line.  Paragraph (k) Training     In the preamble to the \nproposed rule, the Agency requ ested comments  on its proposed training requirements. One commenter \npointed out that a  requirement for fall protection training had not been included in the  proposed rule and \nis needed. (ID -0178.1.) While training is already  required under Sec.  1926.2 1(b)(2),\\104\\ OSHA has \ndetermined that  including a more specific training requirement regarding fall  protection in subpart CC will \nhighlight the requirement and facilitate  compliance. -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--      \\104\\ That provision states: \"The employer shall instruct each  employee in the recognition and \navoidance of unsafe conditions and  the regulations applicable to his work environment to control or  \neliminate any hazards or other exposure to illness or injury.\" -----------------------------------------------------------------\n----------      Therefore, in the final rule, paragraph (k) has been added to this  section. It requires employers \nto ensure that each employee who may be  exposed to a fall hazard while on, or hoisted by, equipment \ncovered by  this subpart is trained on the requirements in subpart CC that address  fall protection and the \napplicable requirements of Sec. Sec.  1926.500  and 1926.502 in subpart M. This provision supplements \nother applicable  training provisions in Sec.  1926.1430 (see discussion below of Sec.   1926.1430, Training). \nAs noted above, OSHA has made a conforming  amendment to Sec.  1926.500(a)(4) to make clear that the \nfall  protection training requirements in Sec.  1926.503 of subpart M do not  apply to fall protection systems \nused to comply with subpart CC. As a  result, the training requirements applicable to Se c.  1926.1423 are  \nfound exclusively in Sec.  1926.1423(k).  General Comment     OSHA received a comment from a safety \nassociation generally  objecting to the adequacy of the fall protection required under this  section. (ID -\n0178.1.) The commenter stated th at OSHA should reference  certain ANSI/ASSE standards addressing fall \nprotection in construction  work, including: ANSI/ASSE A10.32 --2004, Fall Protection Systems for  \nConstruction and Demolition Operations; ANSI/ASSE A10.18--2007, Safety  Requirements for Temporary Roof \nand Floor Holes, Wall Openings,  Stairways, and Other Unprotected Edges; and ANSI/ASSE A10.28 --1998 (R  \n2004), Safety Requirements for Work Platforms Suspended from Cranes or  Derricks. However, the commenter \nhas not pointed to which partic ular  provisions of these consensus standards it believes are appropriately  \nincluded in this rule or that it believes would better effectuate the  purpose of this section than those \ndeveloped by C -DAC.",

The me mbers used this  knowledge to identify issues that required \nparticular attention and to  devise regulatory language that would address the causes of such  accidents. \nTheir extensive practical experience in the construction  industry and the other industries represented on the \nCommittee helped  them to develop revisions to the current subpart N requirements.     C-DAC was chaired \nby a facilitator, Susan L. Podziba of Susan  Podziba & Associates, a firm engaged in public policy mediation and  \nconsensus building. Ms. Podziba's role was to facilitate the  negotiations by: (1) Chairing the Committee's \nmeetings in an impartial  manner; (2) Assisting the members of the committee in conducting  discussions \nand negotiations; and (3) Ensuring minutes of the meetings  were taken, and relevant records retained; (4) \nPerforming other  responsibilities such as drafting meeting summaries to be reviewed and  approved by C-\nDAC members.     C-DAC first met from July 30 to August 1, 2003. Before addressing  substantive issues, \nthe Committee developed ground rules (formally  approved on September 26, 2003) that would guide its \ndeliberations.  (OSHA-S030-2006-0663-0373.) In addition to procedural matters, the  ground rules \naddressed the Committee's decision-making process. C-DAC  agreed that it would make every effort to reach \nunanimous agreement on  all issues. However, if the facilitator determined that unanimous  consent could \nnot be achieved, the Committee w ould consider consensus  to be reached when not more than two non -\nFederal members (i.e., members  other than the OSHA member) dissented; no consensus could be achieved  \nif OSHA dissented.     This consensus process reflects the non-Federal members' view that  Agency support \nof the Committee's work was essential. The non -Federal  members believed that, if OSHA dissented, the \nCommittee's work product  likely would not be included in the final rule. Therefore, the  Committee \nmembers would make every effort to resolve the Agency's  concerns using the negotiation process.      \nUnder the ground rules, if C -DAC reached final consensus on some or  all issues, OSHA would use the \nconsensus-based language in its proposed  standard, and C-DAC members would refrain from providing formal \nwritten  negative comment on those issues in response to the proposed rule.     The ground rules provided \nthat OSHA could only depart from the  consensus-based language by (1) reopening the negotiated rulemaking  \nprocess, or (2) providing t he C -DAC members with a detailed statement  of the reasons for revising the \nconsensus-based language, and do so in  a manner that would allow the C -DAC members to express their \nconcerns  to OSHA before it published the proposed rule. The Committee members  also could provide \nnegative or positive comments in response to these  revisions during the public -comment phase of the \nrulemaking. (OSHA- S030-2006-0663-0373.)     A tentative list of issues for the Committee to address was  \npublished along with the final list of Committee members (68 FR at  39877, Jul. 3, 2003). At its initial meeting, \nthe Committee reviewed  and revised the issue list, adding several issues. (OSHA-S030-2006- 0663-0372.) The \nCommittee met 11 times between July 30, 2003 and July  9, 2004. As the meetings progressed, the Committee \nreached consensus  agreement on various issues and, at the final meeting, reached  consensus agreement \non all outstanding issues.

(ID -0341.) Sixteen states now have a  requirement for  operator \ncertification or licensing. (See, e.g., -0347.1.) Four states  have their own State licensing programs. In addition, \nthe nation's  largest cities also have their own licensing or certification  requirements. One commenter noted \nthat in Ohio, which has no  requirement for crane operator certification, hiring certified  construction crane \noperators had become the norm for the industry. (ID- 0341.) Insurance representatives and other commenters \nat the public  hearings noted that many employers were getting their crane operators  certified as the cost \nwas recouped from premium reductions. (ID -0341; - 0343; -0344.) Accordingly, the Agency has increased its \nestimate of the  number of construction crane operators who already are certified to 60  percent of current \noperators.     The Agency is confident that the estimated costs of operator  certification are not \nunderestimated. The Agency concludes that at  least 5 percent of construction cranes are owner -operated. \n(ID-0025; - 0341.) Since these self-employed individuals or family-owned businesses  have no employees, they \nwill not--for purposes of following the  standard--have to be certified. In some areas, it is the custom for  \ncrane operators to pay for their own certification. (ID-0343.) However,  a new provision in the final standard \nrequires employers to pay for  certification in any event. NCCCO's Mr. Brent testified that: \"There  are some \ncandidates who are paying outright. Some employers have  instituted a vesting program where some fees are \ndue to be repaid if the  employee leaves in a certain period.\" (ID-0343.) In addition, in situations  where crane \noperators are union members, who may be hired out of union hiring  halls, it is likely that training and \ncertification will be performed through  the union rather than an employer. The IUOE pays for their members' \ncrane  training and certifications costs out  of union dues (ID -0341); so while employers,  and ultimately \nowners of new construction projects, may pay for the  cost of union operators' certification via somewhat \nhigher wages, there  is no immediate cost to employers or general contractors for operator  certification. In \naddition, many certification prep courses and exams  are offered on weekends, and there will not be any lost \ntime of  production in such cases. (ID -0343.)     Several small employer representatives on the Small \nBusiness  Advocacy Review Panel remarked that they had no turnover of crane  operators. (OSHA-S030A-\n2006-0664-0019.) Similarly, employers and  associations who provided public testimony at the standard's \npublic  hearings also noted little or no turnover among operators. Accordin gly,  the Agency concludes that \nalthough there may be transfer between  employers, crane operators are a select and highly paid group who \nare  unlikely to exit their field. Employers who lease cranes with  operators, which is the predominant mode \nof crane jobs, or who hire  from union hiring halls would experience no turnover of crane operators  at all. \nPower Lines     The Agency has revised its estimates in the PEA of the \"unit\"  costs of power line work for: \nassembly/disassembly; crane operations  closer than 20 feet to a power line (Sec.  1926.1408); and crane  \noperations within the Table A distances (within 10 feet in most  instances) (Sec.  1926.1410). Comment in \nthe record indicated that  crane operators routinely assess sites for potential power line risks.  (ID-0341; -\n0344.) Thus the Agency concludes that the current baseline  of compliance with assessing power line risks is \n100 percent and this  provision does not impose new  costs on affected employers. The Agency  did not \nestimate costs for work near power lines within Table A  distances for the electric utility industries, power line \nconstruction,  and electric contractors, as these employers work near power lines  under subpart V.     The \nAgency has revised estimates of unit costs for some operations  near power lines. There were two primary \nsources for the revision of  some unit costs of power line work: the written submission by Edison  Electric \nInstitute (EEI) reporting cost information from 16 members and  the testimony and written comment from EEI \nitself.",

The sign-installation  representative commented that the operator-qualification requirements  of \nSec.  1926.1441 would encourage employers to use sm aller cranes at  or near their maximum rated capacity. \nThis commenter indicated that  using 2,000-pound rated-capacity equipment in such a way is less safe  than \nusing higher capacity equipment, which would be operated below its  rated capacity, and at a more optimum \nboom angle. The utilities - industry commenter suggested coupling the 10,000 pound cut -off with a  boom \nlength of 25 feet. A representative from the materials -delivery  industry testified during the hearing of the \nproposed rule that OSHA  should exempt truck-mounted articulated-boom loaders of 10,000 pounds  or less, \nstating that the State of California has such an exemption.  (ID-0343.)     Another commenter, from the \nhome-building industry, believed that  OSHA should raise the capacity cut-off to 70,000 pounds and 120 feet \nof  boom because this industry frequently performs light load lifts such as  hoisting roofing and framing \nmaterials. (ID -0232.) OSHA notes that the  ground conditions at residential construction sites are often \nhazardous  to crane operation because the soil at new -home construction sites is  often disturbed. In \naddition, there may be voids, such as conduits and  sewers, underneath the soil around existing homes. Power",

However, the \nCommittee  determined that such insulating devices do not provide complete  protection because they can \nbe pierced if the equipment makes more than  brushing contact with the device. However, the Committee \nconcluded that  these insulating devices do provide protection if there is brushing  contact and that such \ndevices are useful t o supplement the other  protective measures provided by the requirements of this Sec.   \n1926.1410(d).     One commenter on this provision believed that when work is being  performed under Sec.  \n1926.1410 around voltages above which insulating  line hose or cover-up are available, OSHA should require \nthat the power  line be deenergized and visibly grounded. (ID-0161.1.) Another  commenter stated that the \nCommittee correctly limited the use of line  hoses and similar rubber cover-ups as complete protection since \nit can  be pierced, but stated that it was unfortunate that the Committee  prohibited the use of other rigid \nplastic barriers that are effective  insulation and are not easily pierced. (ID -0144.1.) Regarding the  former \ncomment, OSHA notes that the rul e applies only when the employer  demonstrates that it is infeasible to \ndeenergize and ground the power  line. Also, the provision does not require that line hose or cover -up  be \nmade of rubber; if rigid plastic barriers provide effective  insulation for the voltage involved, they are \npermitted by this  paragraph. OSHA also notes that rigid plastic barriers (that is,  electrically insulating plastic \nguard equipment) is also inte nded for  brush contact only. (See ASTM F712 --06 Standard Test Methods and  \nSpecifications for Electrically Insulating Plastic Guard Equipment for  Protection of Workers.) Although this \nequipment may be able to  withstand higher forces, it is easier to displace than rubber  insulating line hose. \nThis provision is promulgated as proposed.  Paragraph (e)     Under paragraph (e) of this section, the \nprocedures that are  developed to comply with Sec.  1926.1410(d) must be documented and  immediately \navailable on-site. This ensures that these procedures are  available to be used as a reference while the work \nis in progress.      No comments on this provision were submitted, and it is promulgated  as proposed. \nParagraph (f)     Under paragraph (f) of this section, t he equipment user and utility  owner/operator (or \nregistered professional engineer) must meet with the  equipment operator and the other employees who will \nbe in the area of  the equipment or load to review the procedures that are developed under  Sec.  \n1926.1410(d) to prevent a breach of the minimum clearance  distance established under Sec.  1926.1410(c). \nIt is important that  this review take place so that the operator and other employees  understand this critical \ninformation and have the opportunity to  discuss the procedures with the utility owner/operator or registered  \nprofessional engineer who developed the procedures.      OSHA notes that proposed Sec.  1926.1410(f) \nreferred only to the  utility owner/operator. However, under Sec.  1926.1410(d), the  procedures are \ndetermined in a planning meeting with either the utility  owner operator or a registered professional engineer, \nand whichever  entity helped develop those procedures must also participate in the  meeting required under \nparagraph (f). Therefore, OSHA has modified this  paragraph by adding a reference to the registered \nprofessional engineer  as an alternative to the utility owner/operator.      Several electric utility \nrepresentatives questioned OSHA's  authority to impose these and other requirements upon power line \nowners  and operators. (ID -0162.1; -0166.1; -0203.1; -0226.1.) As stated above  in response to similar \narguments, this paragraph does not require the  utility owner/oper ator to take any action.

Tindell,  Williams Power Company, available at http://www.osha.gov; August 11,  \n1994, Memorandum from James W. Stanley, Deputy Assistant Secretary,  available at http://www.osha.gov.     \nTwo commenters objected to the inclusion of overhead and gantry  cranes on the basis that such cranes are \nrarely used in construction  and that a number  of the most significant provisions of the standard,  such as \nthose covering ground conditions and proximity to power lines,  do not apply to overhead and gantry cranes. \n(ID-0122.0; -0191.1.) OSHA  agrees that overhead and gantry cranes that are installed in general  industry \nworkplaces and used only incidentally for construction work in  such facilities should be covered under the \ngeneral industry standard.  This final standard accommodates this objective by providing, in Sec.   \n1926.1438, that overhead and gantry cranes that are permanently  installed in a facility are covered by the \ngeneral industry standard  even though used in construction work, such as re novating the facility  in which \nthey are installed. However, under Sec.  1926.1438, overhead  and gantry cranes that are not permanently \ninstalled in a facility,  such as a launching gantry used in the construction of a bridge, are  covered by this \nstandard. Such cranes are intended to be used for  construction work, present many of the same hazards as \nother equipment  used in construction work, and are properly regulated under this  construction standard.     \nNo other comments were received objecting to the inclusion of items  on the non-exclusive list in paragraph \n(a).     Several commenters asked that construction work performed in  certain industries be excluded from \nthe standard. The industries making  such requests include railroads (ID -0170.1; -0176.1); shipbuilders (ID - \n0195.1); electric utilities (ID-0203.1; -0215.1); and companies that  install signs in buildings under construction \n(ID-0189.1). For all of  these industries, the commenters identify what they believe are  specific problems in \napplying the standard to their activities and  suggest that the most direct way of solving those problems is to  \nexclude them from the standard entirely. For the following reasons,  OSHA declines to exempt construction \nwork performed by employers in  these industries from the scope of this standard.     Two commenters ask \nthat work along railroad rights-of-way be  excluded from the standard. (ID-0170.1; -0176.1.) They claim that a  \nnumber of provisions in the proposed rule are not suitable for railroad  operations, including: (1) The operator \nqualification/certification  requirement because no current certifying organization tests for the  type of \ncranes used by railroads; (2) the requirements for ground  conditions, work area control, and level positioning; \nand (3) the  requirement for a dedicated channel if electronic signals are used.  They also say that most such \nwork is maintenance rath er than  construction. OSHA concludes there is merit in some of the specific  \nconcerns raised by these commenters and addresses those concerns in the  sections of the standard \npertaining to them. However, OSHA sees no  basis for excluding work along railroad rights-of-way from this \nrule.  Some such work, such as the replacement or renovation of automotive  bridges over railroads, is plainly \n\"construction work\" that is  appropriately regulated under this construction standard.      Several \ncommenters raised concerns with the effect that this  rulemaking would have on electric utilities, including: \n(1) The limited  exclusion for digger derricks used in the industry; (2) the proposed  requirement that \nemployers performing subpart V work show that it is  infeasible to maintain the normal clearance from \nenergized power lines  before they can use the less restrictive clearances in subpart V; (3)  application of the \noperator qualification/certification requirement to  the industry; and (4) the duties imposed on utili ty \nemployers when  other employers operate equipment near power lines owned or operated by  the utility \nemployers. (ID-0201.1; -0203.1; -0215.1.) The commenters  suggest that all of these issues can be resolved by \nexcluding utilities  entirely from the standard.",

Paragraph (a)(2)(ii) allows use of a live boom if the equipment is  a \nfloating crane/derrick or is a land crane/derrick on a vessel/  flotation device and none of the circumstances \nlisted in Sec.   1926.1426(a)(1) are present. The Committee found, and OSHA agrees, that  equipment used \non the water commonly has a live boom because the  dynamics of load transfer while on water (from side to \nside), as well  as unexpected wave action can cause rapid changes in list and trim,  which sometimes \nnecessitates that the operator have a free fall boom  system to compensate for these effects. Non-live systems \nare not fast  enough for this purpose. At the public hearing, a witness from the  maritime industry said that \nthe \"unique tasks [associated with  operating cranes on the water] have often required and will continue to  \nrequire a modification of existing cranes and derricks so that they can  safely accomplish these specialized \napplications.\" (ID-0345.41.)     As a result, the Agency concludes that there is no need to modify  this \nprovision; it is promulgated as proposed.     One commenter suggested there is a conflict between the Sec.",

This provision ensures that the trainer monitor can  rapidly and effectively give instructions to the \noperator-in-training,  especially for purposes of correcting anything that the operator -in- training may be \ndoing incorrectly.     With respect to tower cranes, the height of the operator's station  will often make it \ninfeasible to maintain direct line of sight between  the trainer and the operator -in-training. For the same \nreason, use of  hand signals is also often not feasible. Therefore, the provision  instead requires that they be \nin direct communication with each other.  For example, direct communication could be achieved by radio or \nother  instant electronic voice communication system.     Section 1926.1427(f)(4) permits the operator-in-\ntraining to  continue operating the crane in the absence of the trainer for short  breaks under criteria \ndesigned to result in safe operation. This  provision recognizes that monitoring 100 percent of the time is \nneither  practical nor is it necessary fo r safe operation if appropriate  limitations are imposed. Those \nlimitations are listed in paragraphs  (f)(4)(i)-(iii):     Under paragraph (f)(4)(i), the break would be restricted \nto no more  than 15 minutes, with no more than one break per hour.      Under paragraph (f)(4)(ii), \nimmediately prior to the break, the  trainer must inform the operator -in-training of the specific tasks that  \nthe operator-in-training is authorized to perform and the limitations  that he/she must adhere to during the \nbreak.     Under paragraph (f)(4)(iii), the specific tasks that the operator - in-training would perform during \nthe break must be within the operator- in-training's ability.     Proposed paragraph (f)(2)(v) \\119\\ stated that \na \"* * * trainee/  apprentice shall not operate the equipment in any of the following  circumstances.\" This \nparagraph was followed by paragraphs  (f)(2)(v)(A)-(E). Of these, paragraphs (f)(2)(v)(A) -(D) cont ained  \nabsolute prohibitions while paragraph (f)(2)(v)(E) contained a  conditional prohibition. To avoid inconsistency \nbetween paragraph  (f)(2)(v) and the paragraphs that followed, the paragraph, which is now  at Sec.  \n1926.1427(f)(5) has been modified to make clear that there is  an exception at (f)(5)(v). ----------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------      \\119\\ This requirement is now located at Sec.  1926.1427(f)(5).  ---\n------------------------------------------------------------------------      Paragraph (f)(5) recognizes that certain tasks are \ntoo complex or  present such heightened risks that it would be unreasonably dangerous  if a less than fully \nqualified operator were to operate the equipment.  For the circumstances listed in Sec. Sec.  \n1926.1427(f)(5)(i)-(v), the  operator-in-training is prohibited from operating the equipment in all  cases. With \nrespect to operations involving multiple-lift rigging, the  Committee determined that the difficulty and/or risk \ninvolved is not at  the same level as the operations listed in Sec. Sec.   1926.1427(f)(5)(i)-(iv). Consequently, \nwhile Sec.  1926.1427(f)(5)  contains a general prohibition against an operator -in-training  operating the \nequipment during multiple-lift rigging operations, an  exception would apply where the trainer determined \nthat the operator- in-training's skills are sufficient for this high -skill work.     A utility company objected to \nthe requirement in proposed Sec.   1926.1427(f)(2)(v)(A) that operators -in-training who are performing  \nsubpart V work (construction and improvement of power lines) maintain  at least a 20 -foot distance from \nenergized power lines, asking that  operators-in-training only be required to maintain the same clearance  \nfrom power lines (those listed in Table V-1 of subpart V) as certified  operators. (ID-0144.1.) This commenter \nclaimed that the prohibition  would limit the ability of electric utility owners and operators to  provide \noperators-in-training with hands on training.",

The latter includes  hammerhead tower cranes (former Sec.  1926.550(c)(5)) and floating  \ncranes and derricks (former Sec.  1926.550(f)(2)(iii)). Except for  crawler, locomotive, and truck cranes, \ndesign, construction and/or  testing requirements for each of these categories of equipment is  addressed in \na section of this standard that is dedicated to that type  of equipment. This section contains certain \nrequirements applicable only  to crawler, locomotive, and truck cranes and, in addition, contains requirements  \nthat apply to all of the equ ipment covered by this subpart.  Paragraph (a)     Paragraph (a) of this section \nrequires that crawler, truck and  locomotive cranes manufactured prior to the effective date of this  standard \nmeet the applicable requirements for design, construction, and  testing prescribed in ANSI B30.5-1968, safety \ncode for \"Crawler,  Locomotive, and Truck Cranes,\" PCSA \\128\\ Std. No. 2 (1968), the  requirements in \nparagraph (b), or the applicable DIN (Deutsches  Institut f[uuml]r Normung e.V., or German Institute for  \nStandardization) standards that were in effect at the time of  manufacture. --------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------      \\128\\ \"PCSA\" is the acronym for the Power Crane Shovel  Association. ----------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------      This provision allows employers to continue to use \nequipment that  complies with former Sec.  1926.550(b)(2) of subpart N and also gives  them the flexibility \nto use equipment that was built to conform to  applicable DIN standards.     One commenter objected to \nthe inclusion of DIN standards, stating  that those standards are less stringent than the ANSI standard. (ID - \n0178.1.) The commenter did not elaborate on this objection, and OSHA  does not find merit in it. Many cranes \ncurrently in use in the United  States were manufactured in Europe to DIN standards, and OSHA has no  \nreason to conclude that these cranes are any less safe than those  manufactured domestically. Accordingly, \nparagraph (a) is promulgated  without substantive change. OSHA has clarified the paragraph by  splitting the \noptions for compliance into separate paragraphs (1)  through (4), but has not changed any of the requirements. \nParagraph (b)     Paragraph (b) of this section uses the phrase \"mobile and  locomotive cranes\" to reflect \nthe current terminology used in ASME  B30.5-2004. It specifies that such cranes must meet certain provisions  \nof ASME B30.5-2004.     As drafted by C-DAC, paragraph (b) required that mobile (including  crawler and \ntruck) and locomotive cranes manufactured on or after the  effective date of this standard meet certain \nprovisions of ASME B30.5- 2000 with addenda ASME B30.5a-2002, \"Safety Code for Mobile and  Locomotive \nCranes.\" Here, as elsewhere in the proposal, OSHA updated  the provision to refer to the 2004 version of ASME \nB30.5, which was  published after C -DAC completed its draft and was the most current ASME  standard \navailable at the time OSHA prepared the proposed rule for  publication. For the proposed rule, OSHA \ncompared the 2004 and earlier  version and, as discussed below, requested public comment on whether  \ncertain changes in the 2004 version should be adopted. Two commenters  objected to  the revisions to \nincorporate the 2004 standards. (ID - 0205.1; -0213.1.) Neither of these commenters provided specific  \nreasoning or analysis for their positions beyond saying that the 2004  standard was not available at the time \nthe consensus document was  created.",

OSHA is  also concerned that exempting this activity would \nprovide an incentive  for employers to use materials delivery cranes for other purposes,  thereby \nundermining the rationale for the materials delivery exclusion.     In particular, OSHA declines to exclude the \nhandling of HVACR  units, as some commenters urged. Using a crane to  deliver HVACR  equipment is an \nexample of using a crane to hoist and position a  component of the building's mechanical systems, which is an \nintegral  part of the construction process. According to one industry commenter,  during a typical installation \nof a large commercial rooftop HVACR unit,  a mobile crane delivers the equipment to its intended location on \nthe  roof, where an HVACR technician connects the equipment to the  ventilation system. (ID-0165.1) Thus, \nunlike sheet goods and packaged  materials, which are not placed in their location of final use by the  delivery \nvehicle, delivery of HVACR equipment may be integral to its  installation. Like the hoisting and movement of \nother building  components, use of cranes and derricks to move HVACR equipment falls  squarely within this \nrule.     OSHA also received a comment from a representative of the precast  concrete industry requesting \nthe exclusion of equipment used to deliver  materials such as concrete manholes, septic tanks, burial vaults,  \nconcrete block, and concrete pipe. (ID -0299.1) This commenter stated  that their portion of the precast \nconcrete industry solely delivers  materials to a construction site, and believed that they simply supply  \nmaterials for a construction project but are not involved in actual  construction. (ID-0299.1)     OSHA agrees \nthat in circumstances where the equipment is used  solely to deliver these types of concrete materials from a \nsupplier to  a construction site by placing/stacking the materials from the delivery  vehicle to the ground in, \nfor example, a storage or staging area,  without arranging the materials in a particular sequence for \nsubsequent  hoisting, the equipment is not being used for a construction activity.  However, if the equipment \nis used to hoist, hold, support, stabilize or  place precast concrete material as part of the installation process, \nit  is engaged in a construction activity and would be subject to this  rule. For example, a truck -mounted \narticulating crane may be used to  maneuver a precast component such as a vault or concrete pipe from the  \ntruck to its installation point in an excavation. As previously  discussed, such use  is a typical construction \nactivity.     To summarize, when a delivery vehicle is used solely to deliver  building supply materials from \na supplier to a construction site by  placing/stacking the materials on the ground, without arranging the  \nmaterials in a particular sequence for hoisting, the equipment is not  being used for a construction activity \nand is not subject to this rule.  When an articulating/knuckle-boom truck crane that brings material to a  site \nis used to transfer building supply sheet goods or building supply  packaged materials from the vehicle onto a \nstructure, the activity is a  construction activity but the crane is excluded from this rule if it is  equipped with \na properly functioning automatic overload prevention  device and satisfies  the other requirements of the \nexception in Sec.   1926.1400(c)(17). All other equipment that falls under Sec.   1926.1400(a) is subject to \nthis rule when delivering materials onto a  structure.     OSHA is including in the final rule a new Sec.  \n1926.1400(c)(17) to  clarify the circumstances under which material delivery is subject to  the rule. \nParagraph (c)(17)(i) excludes from the scope of this standard  an articulating/knuckle-boom truck crane that \ndelivers material to a  construction site when it is used to transfer materials from it to the  ground, without \narranging the materials in a particular sequence for  hoisting.     Paragraph (c)(17)(ii) contains the exclusion \nfor an articulating/  knuckle-boom truck crane that delivers material to a site when it is  used to transfer \nbuilding supply sheet goods or building supply  packaged materials from it onto a structure, using a fork/cradle \nat the  end of the boom. This provision conditions this exclusion on the truck  crane being equipped with a \nproperly functioning automatic overload  prevention device and lists examples of the sheet goods or packaged",

In this regard,  \nparagraph (b)(1) requires that equipment covered by this section meet  the requirements of Sec. Sec.  \n1926.1403 and 1926.1406 for assembly/ disassembly, while paragraph (b)(2) consists of requirements for the  \ncomponents and configuration of equipment covered by this section. OSHA  received no comments on these \ntwo paragraphs. Paragraph (b)(1) refers  to Sec. Sec.  1926.1403 and 1926.1406 of t his subpart, and the \npreamble  discussion above provides an explanation of these sections, and OSHA's  rationale for including \nthem in the final rule. Because Sec. Sec.   1926.1403 and 1926.1406 are included in paragraph (a), OSHA has  \nmodified the languag e in paragraph (b)(1) for clarity. The requirements  set forth under paragraph (b)(2) \nduplicate the requirements specified  by Sec. Sec.  1926.1404(m)(1), (m)(1)(i), (m)(1)(ii), (m)(2), and (n)  of \nthis subpart; see the discussion under Sec.  1926.1404(m) and (n) of  this preamble for an explanation of \nthese provisions, and OSHA's  rationale for adopting them in the final rule.      Paragraph (b)(3) requires \nemployers to comply with manufacturer  prohibitions for equipment covered by this section. The same  \nrequirement applies to higher-capacity equipment under Sec.   1926.1404(n). OSHA received no comments \non the proposed paragraph and  is including the provision in the final rule as proposed beca use the  \nCommittee agreed that manufacturers' prohibitions are designed to  prevent hazards that can arise with the \nuse of their products.     Paragraph (c) of this section specifies procedural requirements for  operating the \nequipment. Paragraph (c)(1) requires the employer to  comply with all manufacturer procedures applicable to \nequipment  operation, including equipment operation with attachments. The same  requirement applies to \nhigher-capacity equipment under Sec.   1926.1417(a). OSHA received no comme nts on the proposed \nparagraph and  is including the provision in the final rule as proposed because the  Committee agreed that \nmanufacturer procedures are designed to prevent  hazards that can arise with the use of their products.      \nThe requirements in paragraph (c)(2) apply to equipment for which  manufacturer operating procedures are \nunavailable. Under these  conditions, paragraph (c)(2)(i) requires the employer to develop, and  ensure \ncompliance with, the procedures necessary for the safe operation  of the equipment and its attachments.      \nParagraph (c)(2)(ii) specifies that the employer must ensure that a  qualified person develops the procedures \nfor operational controls. The  Committee concluded that, because these procedures are highly complex  and \ncritical to operational control of the equipment, a qualified  person has the high degree of expertise necessary \nto ensure proper  development of the control procedures.     When the employer develops the operating \nprocedures for this  equipment, paragraph (c)(2)(iii) requires that procedures related to  the capacity of the \nequipment be developed and signed by a professional  engineer familiar with the equipment. The Committee \nconcluded that,  because the type and complexity of engineering analysis needed to  develop safe \nprocedures related to capacity, a registered professional  engineer who is familiar with the equipment must  \nperform this task. The  Committee also agreed that signing the procedures was necessary to  ensure that the \nengineer performed the task with the requisite level of  care.     No commenters responded to the \nprovisions of proposed paragraph  (c). OSHA is ad opting these provisions in the final rule as proposed  \nbecause (1) the provisions are consistent with the consensus reached by  the Committee, and (2) will ensure \nthat, absent manufacturer  procedures, employers develop procedures that will protect workers  as  \neffectively as operating procedures developed by the equipment  manufacturer when implemented as \nrequired.     Paragraph (c)(3) of the final rule addresses the provision of  operating information to the \nequipment operator. Equipment covered by  this section may not have an operator's cab; therefore, paragraph  \n(c)(3)(i) requires that the load chart be made available to the  operator at the control station rather than in",

It also requires that, if tag  lines are \nused to guide the load, the lines must be non-conductive.  Finally, if maintaining the normal clearance distance \nis infeasible, a  number of additional measures must be implemented, one o f which is the  use of an \ninsulating link between the end of the load line and the  load.     These measures protect employees \nguiding the load in several ways,  including: reducing the chance that a crane would contact a power line;  \nemployees using tag lines to guide a load from being electrocuted  should the load become energized.     5. \nAugust 21, 2003. Three fatalities. A crane operator and two co- workers were electrocuted when a truck crane's \nelevated boom contacted  a 7,200 volt uninsulated primary conductor 31 feet above the ground.  When the \noperator stepped from the cab of the truck, a conduction  pathway to the ground was established through the \noperator's right hand  and right foot, resulting in electrocution. A co -worker at tempted to  revive the \nincapacitated crane operator with cardio-pulmonary  resuscitation (\"CPR\"), while a third co-worker contacted \n911, and  then returned to the incident location. When the third co -worker  simultaneously touched the \nenergized truck crane and the back of the  co-worker performing CPR, the resulting pathway conducted the  \nelectrical charge through the workers, electrocuting them all. (ID- 0017.12.)     The final standard will avoid \nthis type of accident. Section  1926.1408 ensures that a mi nimum safe distance from the power line is  \nmaintained, which prevents equipment from becoming energized. Also,  when working closer than the normal \nminimum clearance distance, the  crane must be grounded, which reduces the chance of an electrical  \npathway through the workers.     In addition, Sec.  1926.1408(g) requires that the operator be  trained to \nremain inside the cab unless an imminent danger of fire or  explosion is present. The operator also must be \ntrained in the hazards  associated with simultaneously touching the equipment and the ground,  as well as \nthe safest means of evacuating the equipment. The crane's  remaining crew must be trained to avoid \napproaching or touching the  equipment. The required training is reinforced by the electrocution  warnings \nthat must be posted in the cab and on the outside of the  equipment.     6. September 28, 1999: One fatality. \nA 19-year old electrical  instrument helper was at a construction site that was on a  manufacturing company's \nproperty. A contractor positioned a 50-ton  hydraulic crane in an open area that consisted of compacted fill  \nmaterial. This area was the only location that the crane could be  situated because the receiving area for the \nequipment was too close to  the property border.     The crane's outriggers were set, but matting was \nplaced only under  one of the outrigger pads. As the crane was moving large sections of  piping to a new \nlocation, the ground collapsed and the crane  overturned, striking the helper. (ID -0017.13.)     Section \n1926.1402, Ground conditions, will prevent this type of  accident. Under that section, employers must ensure \nthat the surface on  which a crane is oper ating is sufficiently level and firm to support  the crane in \naccordance with the manufacturer's specifications. In  addition, Sec.  1926.1402 imposes specific duties on \nboth the entity  responsible for the project (the controlling entity) and the entity  operating the crane to \nensure that the crane is adequately supported.  It places responsibility for ensuring that the ground conditions \nare  adequate on the controlling entity, while also making the employer  operating the crane responsible \nnotifying the c ontrolling entity of any  deficiency in the ground conditions, and having the deficiency  \ncorrected before operating the crane.     7. June 17, 2006: One fatality.

In the \nCommittee's  experience, the operator will tend to react to a directional signal,  such as \"forward,\" by acting \non the signal from the operator's  perspective. This provision ensures that the sign al that is given will  be \nconsistent with that natural tendency. No comments were received on  this provision; it is included in the final \nrule without change. Paragraph (l) [Reserved.] Paragraph (m) Communication With Multiple Cranes/Derricks     \nParagraph (m) of this section addresses a situation where one or  more signal person(s) is in communication \nwith more than one crane or  derrick (for example, during multiple crane lifts). It requires each  signal person \nto use an effective means of identifying which crane or  derrick the signal is for. Sections 1926.1419(m)(i) and \n(ii) set out  alternate means of complying with this requirement. Under Sec.   1926.1419(m)(i), for each \nsignal the signal person must, prior to  giving the function/direction, identify the crane/derrick for which the  \nsignal is intended. Alternatively, under Sec.  1926.1419(m)(ii), the  employer could implement a method of \nidentifying the crane/derrick for  which the signal is intended that is as effective as the system in  Sec.  \n1926.1419(m)(i). For example, under Sec.  1926.1419(m)(ii), the  signal person could simultaneously identify \nthe crane and provide the  signal. Because of the potential for confusion, it is essential that an  alternative \nsystem under Sec.  1926.1419(m)(ii) be equally effective as  Sec.  1926.1419(m)(i) in clearly conveying, on \na consistent basis, the  crane/derrick to which each signal is directed. No comments were  received on this \nprovision; it is included in the final rule without  substantive change. The wording of the paragraph has been \nmodified with  several minor grammatical changes.  Section 1926.1420 Signals --Radio, Telephone, or Ot her \nElectronic  Transmission of Signals      C-DAC concluded that certain criteria are needed to ensure the  \nreliability and clarity of electronically transmitted signals; these  criteria are listed in Sec. Sec.  1926.1420(a) \nthrough (c). Paragraph  (a) of this section requires the testing of the transmission devices  prior to the start \nof operations to make certain that the signals are  clear and that the devices are reliable. This helps ensure \nthat the  operator receives, and can understand, the signals that are given, and  will prevent accidents caused \nby miscommunication.     One commenter, remarking that a second or two of delay may still  pose a \nsignificant safety hazard, suggested that Sec.  1926.1420(b) be  amended to read, \"Signal transmission must \nbe through a dedicated  channel without noticeable delay * * *.\" (ID -0172.1.)     OSHA agrees that a \nnoticeable delay in transmission of an  electronic signal could pose a significant hazard and has decided to  \naddress this concern by adding the requirement  that signal transmission  be \"effective.\" To be effective, a \ntransmitted signal must produce or  be capable of producing the intended result. In other words, a signal  \nmust be transmitted and understood by the crane operator in such a way  and within such a time as would \nallow the operator to respond to the  signal and operate the crane in a safe manner.      Paragraph (b) of \nthis section requires that signals be transmitted  through a dedicated channel. As defined in Sec.  1926.1401, \na  \"dedicated channel\" is \"a line of communication assigned by the  employer who controls the \ncommunication system to only one signal  person and crane/derrick or to a coordinated group of \ncranes/derricks/ signal person(s).\"",

In such circumstances the employer is prohibited from \nallowing the  individual to continue working as a signal person until he or she is  re-trained and has been \nrequalified in accordance with Sec.   1926.1428(a). No comments were received on this provision; it is  \npromulgated as proposed.      Paragraph (c) of this section sets forth the qualification  requirements for \nsignal persons. Paragraph (c)(1) requires that the  signal person know and understand whatever signal method \nwill be used  for that particular job site.     In addition, if hand signals are used, the signal person must know  \nand understand the Standard Method for hand signals. Hand signals are  widely used in this industry. As \ndiscussed a bove with respect to Sec.   1926.1419(c), C -DAC determined that accidents due to \nmiscommunication  could be reduced if there were more widespread use of standardized hand  signals. C-\nDAC concluded that this provision will promote greater use  of standardized hand signals through the use of \nthe Standard  Method.\\124\\ No comments were received on this provision; it is  promulgated as proposed. \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\124\\ As discussed above with respect to Sec.  \n1926.1419(c),  there are circumstances when it would be permissible to use hand  signals other than the \nStandard Method signals. Also, under Sec.   1926.1419, signals other than hand signals can be used. ----------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------      Paragraph (c)(2) of this section will help prevent \nmiscommunication  between the signal person and the crane operator by requiring the  signal person to be \ncompetent in the application of whatever signals  are used. No comments were received on this provision; it \nis  promulgated as proposed.     Paragraph (c)(3) of this section requires the signal person to have  a basic \nunderstanding of crane operation and limitations, including crane  dynamics involved in swinging and stopping \nloads and boom deflection from  hoisting loads. As explained in the proposed rule preamble, it is critical  that \nthe signal person understand how the crane and load will move in response  to the various signals he or she \ngives so that the signal person will give  the most appropriate signals and reduce the occurrence of struck-by, \ncrushed-by  and other hazards (see 73 FR 59823, Oct. 9, 2008) . No comments were received on  this \nprovision; it is promulgated as proposed.     Paragraph (c)(4) of this section specifies that signal persons must  \nknow and understand the relevant requirements in Sec. Sec.  1926.1419 - 1926.1422, which address the types \nof signals that may be used and the  circumstances surrounding their use, and the requirements of Sec.   \n1926.1428. C -DAC included the phrase \"relevant requirements\" to make  clear that a signal person's \nqualification could be limited with  regards to th e use of a particular type of signal and associated  \ninformation.     For example: A crane operation is going to use Standard Method hand  signals. The signal \nperson knows and understands all aspects of Sec.   1926.1419 that are relevant when using hand signals, as \nwell as Sec.   1926.1422, Signals--hand signal chart. In addition, the signal person  meets the requirements \nin Sec.  1926.1428(c)(1) and (2) with respect to  the use of Standard Method hand signals. The signal person \nalso has the  knowledge nece ssary to meet the provision in Sec.  1926.1428(c)(3), and  demonstrates \nthrough a verbal or written test, and through a practical  test, that he/she has this knowledge and capabilities. \nHowever, the  signal person is unfamiliar with the contents of Sec.  1926.1420,  Signals--radio, telephone or \nother electronic transmission of signals,  or of Sec.  1926.1421, Signals --voice signals --additional \nrequirements.     In this example, it would be appropriate for the signal person to  be qualified under either \nOption (1) or Option (2) of this section (see  1926.1428(a)) so long as that qualification was limited to signaling  \nwith Standard Method hand signals.",

The second option for identifying the work zone (Sec.   \n1926.1408(a)(1)(ii)) is to define the work zone as the area 360 degrees  around the crane, up to the crane' s \nmaximum working radius. In other  words, under this option, the work zone is the area within a circle,  with \nthe crane at the center, and the radius defined by the maximum  working radius of the crane. No boundaries \nwould have to be marked  under this op tion since the crane would be permitted to operate in the  entire \narea that it could reach.  Paragraph (a)(2)     Once the employer has identified the work zone according to \nSec.   1926.1408(a)(1), it is then required to make the power line hazard  assessment. Specifically, it must \ndetermine if any part of the crane,  load or load line (including rigging and lifting accessories) could  come \nwithin a \"trigger\" distance --20 feet of a power line. This  determination must be made based upon the \nassumption that t he crane  would be operated up to its maximum working radius (or, if a demarcated  \nboundary is used, the assessment must be made with the assumption that  the crane would be operated up \nto that boundary).      Three commenters expressed concern over OSHA's use of the term  \"maximum \nworking radius\" in describing the methodology for defining  the work zone. (ID -0146.1; -0206.1; -0209.1.) \nTheir concern is that  using \"maximum working radius\" would trigger the encroachment - prevention \nrequirements of Sec.  1926.1408(b) on construction sites  where the equipment operator has no intention \nof using the equipment up  to the equipment's maximum working distance. Another commenter  questioned \nwhether the phrase \"any part of the equ ipment\" would  include the boom if the boom \"could be lowered \nwithin 20 feet of a  power line even though the working radius will not require encroachment  into the 20-\nfoot zone.\" (ID-0178.1.)     OSHA notes that these concerns are already addressed throug h a  mechanism \nin the provision as proposed: the employer's ability, under  Sec.  1926.1408(a)(1)(i), to define the work zone \nboundaries and then  prohibit operation of the equipment beyond those boundaries. In other  words, \nemployers may define the boundary of a work zone at the outer  boundary of the intended working radius of \nany part of the equipment,  including the boom.      To illustrate, if an employer is using a crane with a \nmaximum  working radius of 100 feet, but intends to extend the crane boom o ut  only 75 feet beyond the \ncenter point of the crane, that employer can  demarcate the outer boundary of the work zone using such \nmeasures as a  line of flags, and then prohibit crane operations beyond that 75 -foot  work zone boundary. \nTherefore, in the one commenter's example of where  the boom could come within 20 feet of a power line \nbut the work does  not require it, the employer need not take encroachment -prevention measures  if it \nprohibits working beyond a radius that would bring the boom  within 20 feet of the line. OSHA concludes, \ntherefore, that no change  to the proposed regulatory language is needed to address these concerns  and is \npromulgating this paragraph as proposed.     If, after defining a work zone, an employer determines that the \n20  foot \"trigger\" determination is positive, then the employer is  required to take additional steps. \nSpecifically, the employer must meet  the requirements under either, Option (1), Option (2), or Option (3) of  \nSec.  1926.1408(a)(2). \\42\\ See above discussion of Sec.  1926.1407(a)  for additional information about \nhow OSHA intends to enforce these  compliance options. --------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------      \\42\\ If no part of the crane, load or load line could come  closer than 20 feet to a power line, the \nemployer is not required to  take any further action under this section. However, the employer  may \nencounter a situation where it unexpectedly needs to increase  the size of the work zone.",

This definition  is being included in Sec.  1926.1401, as is the \ndefinition for  \"repetitive lifts\" proposed by OSHA and quoted above.  Paragraph (e)(3)     This proposed \nparagraph specified additional requirements that must  be met when Types II  and III rotation resistant wire \nrope are used with  an operating design factor of between 3.5 and 5 (for non-duty cycle,  non-repetitive lifts). \nThe Committee concluded that these additional  requirements are needed to ensure that use of such ropes \nwould be safe.

Two commenters noted the illustration of  a tower crane in figure 2 of the proposed rule and \nsuggested it be  replaced with a mobile crane. (ID -0205.1;-0213.1.) Two commenters  recommended that \nfigures 4 and 6 be changed such that no pins would be  permitted to be removed without blocking the entire \nboom. (ID-0131.1; - 0292.) Specifically, these commenters did not believe that the bottom  boom connecting \npins could be removed due to the weight of the  cantilevered boom exerting force on these bottom connecting \npins. They  stated that if there was sufficient clearance between the connecting  lugs to enable the pins to \nbe removed, the boom could move downward  upon the removal of the pins.      Based upon C -DAC's \nexpertise, OSHA determines that figures 2, 4 and  6 in the proposed rule were accurate depictions as to \nblocking, but the  proposed arrows may have been confusing to the extent that commenters  incorrectly \nunderstood that the removal  of pins would be allowed where  arrows did not appear. To avoid confusion, \nOSHA is not including any of  the assembly/disassembly figures from the proposed rule in the final  rule.",

Much like em ployees who must receive a suspended  \nload in a shaft, employees have limited ability to escape a free  falling boom or load in a cofferdam. However, \ncofferdams are typically  much larger work spaces than shafts, the fall zone of a falling boom or  load may \nonly affect one part of the cofferdam. Therefore, this  provision only applies when employees are in the fall \nzone of the boom  or load.      OSHA noted an ambiguity in proposed Sec.  1926.1426(a)(1)(v). The  \nexception referred only to \"the fall zone\"; OSHA determines that--to  make this provision consistent with Sec.  \n1926.1426(a)(1)(i)  (prohibiting the use of live booms when an employee is in the fall zone  of the boom or \nthe load) --the words \"of the boom or load\" should be  added to the language propos ed for Sec.  \n1926.1426(a)(1)(v).     Paragraph (a)(1)(vi) prohibits use of a live boom for lifting  operations in a refinery \nor tank farm. A free falling boom could strike  pipes or a tank in a refinery or tank farm. Such accidental impact  \ncould cause a r elease of toxic materials or conflagration. No comments  were received for this provision; it is \npromulgated as proposed.     Paragraph (a)(2) of this section is the exclusive list of  conditions under which \nthe use of cranes with live booms is permitted.  C-DAC found that cranes with live booms can be used safely \nunder some  circumstances and did not determine that the cost of replacing or  retrofitting all such \nequipment is justified a s long as the use of live  boom equipment is limited to these conditions. However, \nnone of the  conditions outlined in Sec.  1926.1426(a)(1) may be present.      Paragraph (a)(2)(i) allows the \nuse of equipment with a live boom if  that equipment was manufactured prior to October 31, 1984, and none \nof  the circumstances listed in Sec.  1926.1426(a)(1) are present. ANSI  B30.5 first prohibited live booms in \nthe 1972 version and reiterated  the prohibition in the 1982 edition, which was published on October 31,   \n1983, and became effective on October 31, 1984.     OSHA concludes that manufacturers would have begun \nto phase out  live-boom equipment when ANSI first prohibited its use in 1972 and that  few, if any, live boom \nequipment would have been manufactured after  October 31, 1984. Moreover, during this period, hydraulic \nhoisting  equipment, the design of which typically precluded boom free fall even  in its early designs, became \nmore prevalent.     In light of these factors, the Agency concludes that most equi pment  manufactured \nafter October 31, 1984, would not have live booms. Section  1926.1426(a)(2) thus allows the older live boom \nequipment to be phased  out safely by restricting its use to situations in which none of the  circumstances \nlisted in Sec.  1926 .1426(a)(1) are present. However,  OSHA added a new provision to this paragraph that \nconsiders live-boom  equipment manufactured on or after October 31, 1984, and meeting the  requirements \nof paragraph (b) of this section, not to be subject to the  limitations of paragraph (a) of this section. OSHA \nconsiders such  equipment, when so modified, to be as safe as any equipment modified  under the \nrequirements of paragraph (b).      Paragraph (a)(2)(ii) allows use of a live boom if the equipment is  a \nfloating crane/derrick or is a land crane/derrick on a vessel/  flotation device and none of the circumstances \nlisted in Sec.   1926.1426(a)(1) are present. The Committee found, and OSHA agrees, that  equipment used \non the water commonly has a live boom because the  dynamics of load transfer while on water (from side to \nside), as well  as unexpected wave action can cause rapid changes in list and trim,  which sometimes \nnecessitates that the operator have a free fall boom  system to compensate for these effects.",
    "22c71a5b-d3ac-4ce8-987d-ca709381f88f": "page_label: 118\nfile_name: OSHA-Final Rule-Cleaned.pdf\nfile_path: C:\\Users\\bs44876\\Desktop\\Project\\CII-Crane\\FineEmb\\dataset\\data\\OSHA-Final Rule-Cleaned.pdf\nfile_type: application/pdf\nfile_size: 3496317\ncreation_date: 2025-01-07\nlast_modified_date: 2025-01-07\n\npublic comments and testimony, OSHA recognized that  there would be situations where an employer rents \nor uses equipment  owned by another party or where multiple employers use the same piece  of equipment. \nThe standard allows any employer to conduct the monthly  inspection. The employer who conducts the \ninspection must document the  items checked and the results of the inspection and must retain it for  a \nminimum of three months. If employers whose employees use the  equipment rely on another employer to \nconduct, document, and maintain  the record of the monthly inspection, it is the responsibility of each  \nemployer engaged in construction activities to assure compliance with  the standard.     OSHA determines \nthat it is in the interest of all employers who  conduct monthly inspections, w hether they use or own \nequipment, to  share the inspection results with each employer who uses the equipment.  However, \nemployers engaged in construction activities are responsible  for assuring compliance with the standard. \nTherefore, if an employer  engaged in construction activities is unable to assure that another  employer has \nconducted the monthly inspection, then the employer  engaged in construction activities must conduct a \nmonthly inspection  prior to using the equipment. The monthly inspection is  similar to a  shift inspection \n(with the addition of the monitoring of deficiencies  that a qualified person deemed not to be a safety hazard \nin the annual  inspection), but, unlike a shift inspection, the monthly inspection  must be documented and \nmaintained. Requiring an employer who uses the  equipment to conduct a monthly inspection when that \nemployer is unable  to determine whether another employer conducted a monthly inspection is  an \ninsignificant burden compared to the safety benefit of ensuring th is  inspection is completed.      The \nSBREFA Panel also recommended that OSHA restate the corrective  action provisions from the shift inspection \n(Sec.  1926.1412(d)(2) and  (3)) in paragraph (e) of this section. Under Sec.  1926.1412(e)(1), the  monthly \ninspection must be conducted in accordance with Sec.   1926.1412(d) on shift inspections, meaning that the \ncorrective action  provisions in Sec.  1926.1412(d)(2) and (3) must also be followed in  the monthly \ninspections. OSHA requested comment on whether the language  in Sec.  1926.1412(d)(2) and (3) should be \nrepeated under Sec.   1926.1412(e). Two trade associations believed that clarity would be  improved if \nparagraph (e) of this subpart repeated the corrective  actions provisions from the shift inspection paragraph. \n(ID-0205; - 0213.) OSHA disagrees because Sec.  1926.1412(e)(1) explicitly requires  this inspection to be \ndone in accordance with Sec.  1926.1412(d).  Paragraph (d) immediately precedes paragraph (e), and OSHA \nconcludes  that repeating the provisions will create, rather than alleviate,  confusion by requiring employers \nto read two lists that contain  identical information. Paragraph (f) Annual/Comprehensive     Paragraph (f) \nof this section requires an annual (i.e., once every  twelve months), general inspection of the equipment, the \nthird of the  three regularly scheduled general inspections that are required by this  standard. It promotes \nsafety by ensuring that a thorough, comprehensive  inspection of the equipment is performed to detect and \naddress  deficiencies that might not be detected in the shift and monthly  inspections.     Under \nparagraph (f)(1), a qualified person must inspect the  equipment. The Committee specified a qualified person \nbecause the items  required in the shift inspection must be examined more thoroughly than  during the shift \nor monthly inspections. The Committee, determined, and  OSHA agrees, that the higher level of expertise of \na qualified person  would help to ensure that the inspector was able to identify  deficiencies necessitating a \ngreater degree of scrutiny than what would  be required in the shift inspection; for example, a deficiency that \nis  not apparent in a visual inspection but is detectable through taking  apart equipment components. The \nCommittee's decision to require a  qualified person is consistent with COE-EM 385-1-1 (3 Nov 03) and ASME  \nB30.5-2004, both of which call for a qualified person t o perform those  standards' \"periodic\" inspections.",

In the proposal, OSHA noted that it interpreted \n\"structural  supports\" in this provision to include both the portions of the  structure used for support and \nthe means of attaching the tower to the  structure, and requested public comment on whether proposed Sec.   \n1926.1435(b)(3) stated this in tent with sufficient clarity.      Five commenters recommended that OSHA \nclarify that \"structural  supports\" means both the portions of the structure used for support  and the means \nof attachment. (ID-0120.0; -0156.1; -0180.1; -0205.1; - 0213.1.) OSHA has m odified paragraph (b)(3) of this \nsection of the  final rule accordingly.     Section 1926.1435(b)(4), Addressing specific hazards, requires the  \nemployer to comply with Sec. Sec.  1926.1404(h)(1) through (9), which  pertain to erecting, climbing and \ndismantling. In particular, Sec.   1926.1404(h) requires that the A/D Director address certain hazards,  which \nare discussed above in the discussion of Sec.  1926.1404. Section  1926.1435(b)(4) lists additional hazards, \nspecific to tower cranes,  that the A/D Di rector also must address. These additional hazards are  those \nassociated with (i) the foundations and structural supports for  tower cranes, (ii) the loss of backward stability, \nand (iii) wind  speed.     Proposed Sec.  1926.1435(b)(4)(i) required the A/D Director to  \"verify\" that the \nfoundation and structural supports are installed in  accordance with their design. This paragraph is designed \nto ensure that  the design of these components by the manufacturer or registered  professional engineer is \nfollowed when they are installed.      Three commenters stated that the A/D Director is not qualified to  \nperform this function and that the registered professional engineer who  designed the support should verify \nthat the foundation and structural  supports are properly installed. (ID-0180.1; -0205.1; -0213.1.)     OSHA \ndetermines that the commenters are assuming that, by the use  of the term \"verify,\" the proposed provision \nmeant that the A/D  Director would have to independently assess the foundation and supports  to determine \nif they were installed in accordance with their design.  OSHA is not, however, requiring the A/D Director to \nmake such an  independent assessment. For example, the intent of the provision is met  when the A/D \nDirector determines from the engineer of record that the  installation was done correctly. To make this clear, \nOSHA has, in the  final rule, changed the word \"verify\" to \"determine.\"     Paragraph (b)(4)(ii) requires that \nthe A/D Director address the  backward stability of the crane before self erecting tower cranes or  cranes on \ntraveling or stationary undercarriages are swung. OSHA has  removed the words \"must be considered\" that \nwere in the proposed  paragraph to avoid ambiguity. Paragraph (b)(4) requires the A/D  Director to \"address\" \ncertain issues, including the stability issue  in paragraph (b)(4)(ii), and the words \"must be considered\" could \nbe  read as l imiting or modifying that duty. This provision is similar to  the assembly/disassembly \nrequirement in Sec.  1926.1404(h)(11) except  that it applies only to self erecting tower cranes and cranes \nthat are  on traveling or static (stationary) undercarriages. It applies to these  types of tower cranes to \nhighlight the fact that, because they do not  have a base that is fixed to the ground,  the backwards stability \nsafety  issue needs to be addressed. No comments were received on this  provision, and it is promulgated \nwith only the one revision.      Proposed Sec.  1926.1435(b)(4)(iii) provided that erecting,  climbing, and \ndismantling not take place when the wind speed  recommended by the manufacturer is exceeded. Where the \nmanufacturer  does not recommend a maximum wind speed, a qualified person is required  to establish the \nmaximum wind speed that must not be exceeded.",

Paragraphs (c)(2)(iv) and (v) track similar provisions in secs. 6- 1.2.2(c) and (d) of ANSI B30.6-1969 and \nASME B30.6-2003. No comments  were received on (c)(2)(v); it is promulgated as proposed      Additional \ninstallation requirements for guy derricks that are  specific to the anchoring of its guys are addressed in Sec.   \n1926.1436(d).     In the proposed rule, Sec. Sec.  1926.1436(c) and 1926.1436(d) both  contained \nrequirements related to guy derricks. OSHA asked for public  comment as to whether having specifications for \nguy derricks in both  paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section could lead to confusion or  impede compliance \nwith its provisions. Several commenters believed that  the two sets of proposed requirements for guy derricks \nshould be  combined. (ID-0180.1; -0205.1; -0213.1.) However, the commenters did  not offer an explanation \nfor how this would prevent confusion or  enhance compliance. Upon consideration, OSHA disagrees with the  \ncommenters and therefore, requirements for guy derricks will be found  in both paragraphs (c) and (d) of this \nsection, just as in the proposed  rule.     Paragraph (c)(3), Stiffleg derricks, provides additional  \nrequirements specific to stiffleg derricks to help ensure their safe  use. These requirements which have not \nbeen changed from the proposal  are similar to those in secs. 6 -1.2.2(c) and (d) of ANSI B30.6 -1969 and  \nASME B30.6-2003.     Paragraph (c)(3)(i) requires the mast to be supported in the  vertical position by at \nleast two stifflegs; one end of each must be  connected to the top of the mast and the other end securely \nanchored.     Paragraph (c)(3)(ii) specifies that stifflegs must be capable of  withstanding the loads imposed \nat any point of operation within the  rated load chart range.     Paragraph (c)(3)(iii) specifies that the mast \nbase must: (A) permit  the mast to rotate freely (when necessary); and (B) permit deflection  of the mast \nwithout binding.     Paragraph (c)(3)(iv) states that the mast must be prevented from  lifting out of its socket \nwhen the mast is in tension.      Paragraph (c)(3)(v) requires the stiffleg connecting member at the  top of \nthe mast to: (A) permit the mast to rotate freely (when  necessary); (B) withstand the loads imposed by the \naction of the  stifflegs; and (C) be secured so as to oppose separating forces.      OSHA requested public \ncomment on whether the provisions in  paragraphs (c)(3) and (d)(3), which both contained requirements for  \nstiffleg derricks, needed to be changed or modified to avoid potential  confusion. As discussed above, with \nrespect to the requirements for guy  derricks in both paragraphs (c) and (d), OSHA has decided to adhere to  \nthe proposal; requirements for stiffleg derricks will be found in both  paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.      \nParagraph (c)(4) of this section, Gin pole derricks, contains  additional requirements specific to gin pole \nderricks to help ensure thei r  safe use. Similar requirements are found in sec. 6 -1.2.4 of ASME B30.6 -2003.  \nNo comments were received for paragraph (c)(4); it is promulgated as proposed.     Under paragraph (c)(4)(i), \nguy lines must be sized and spaced so as  to make the gin pole stable in both boomed and vertical positions. \nIf  the size and/or spacing of guy lines does not result in the gin pole  being stable in both boomed and \nvertical positions, the employer must  ensure that the derrick is not used in an un stable position.      \nParagraph (c)(4)(ii) requires that the base of the gin pole permit  movement of the pole (when necessary).      \nUnder paragraph (c)(4)(iii), the gin pole must be anchored at the  base against horizontal forces (when such \nforces are present).",

Section 1926.1419 Signals --General Requirements      \nThis section sets requirements regarding signals when using  equipment covered by this standard. C -DAC \ndetermined that addressing  these issues is one of the means by which the number of injuries and  fatalities \ncaused by \"struck -by\" incidents, in which the equipment or  load strikes an employee, can be reduced.  \nParagraph (a)     Paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section address the  circumstances that require the \nuse of a signal person: (1) When the  point of operation, meaning the load travel path or the area near or at  \nload placement, is not in full view of the operator (Sec.   1926.1419(a)(1)); (2) when the equipment is traveling \nand the  operator's view in the direction of travel is obstructed (Sec.   1926.1419(a)(2)); and (3) when, due \nto site specific safety concerns,  either the operator or the pers on handling the load determines it is  \nnecessary (Sec.  1926.1419(a)(3)). The first two of these circumstances  involve an obvious hazard--limited \noperator visibility. With respect to  the third circumstance, C -DAC determined that other situations arise  \nthat, from a safety standpoint, necessitate the use of a signal person  (see examples in the preamble to the \nproposed rule at 73 FR 59796, Oct.  9, 2008).     One commenter, representing the interests of the material \ndelivery  industry, suggested that Sec.  1926.1419(a) be changed to specify that,  if a signal person is \nneeded at the site due to the obstructed view of  the operator when delivering building materials, then the \nconstruction  site customer (not the material delivery employer) would be responsib le  for providing the \nsignal person. (ID-0184.1.) OSHA concludes that the  question of whether the material delivery employer or \nthe construction  site customer should bear the cost of providing the signal person when  required is an \neconomic issue that is  most appropriately left to the  parties to resolve.      During the public hearing, a \nlabor representative stated that his  organization believes that a signal person is always necessary when  \nworking with cranes. (ID-0343.) Two commenters representing the  materials delivery industry disagreed (ID-\n0184.1; -0218.1.)     OSHA has decided to defer to the expertise of the Committee, which  found that a \nsignal person should only be required in the three  circumstances listed in Sec.  1926.1419(a). Moreover, \nOSHA notes the  requirement in Sec.  1926.1419(a)(3), which provides that a signal  person must be \nprovided if the crane operator or pers on handling the  load determines a signal person is necessary due to \nsite specific  safety concerns. This provision, in particular, ensures that a signal  person will be required when \nnecessary.     One commenter asked for clarification on the meaning of \"full view  of the operator\" in Sec.  \n1926.1419(a)(1). (ID-292.1.) In particular,  the commenter asked whether mirror or camera systems would \nmeet this  requirement. Another commenter suggested adding language allowing the  use of boom mounted \nvideo cameras for blind lifts. (ID -0120.0.)     A live video system that provides a full view to the crane  \noperator--i.e., provides a sufficiently broad, clear and detailed view  to enable the operator to see all that is \nneeded to operate the  equipment safely--would meet the \"full view of the operator\"  requirement. Mirrors, \non the other hand, typically distort images or  distances and thus would not normally be sufficient to provide \na \"full  view.\"     The sufficiency of any system will depend on the particular needs   posed by each \nsituation. For this reason, OSHA has decided to rely on  C-DAC's clear and succinct phrase, \"full view of the \noperator,\"  rather than to attempt to further define that concept or to list  acceptable devices in the \nregulatory text.",

Another commenter suggested \nthat if the Agency is going to allow  employer procedures, a written copy should be required to be kept on  \nthe job site for the use of the entire crew. (ID -0178.1.)     The final rule requires that the A/D director \nunderstand the  assembly/disassembly procedures. In addition, the A/D director must  review the \nassembly/disassembly procedures prior to starting the  assembly/disassembly process unless the A/D director \nis experienced in  having used them on the same type and con figuration of equipment and is  able to \nrecollect the procedures such that review is unnecessary. (See  Sec.  1926.1404(b).) Furthermore, before \nbeginning assembly/disassembly  operations, the A/D director must determine that the crew members  \nunderstand their tasks and the associated hazards, as well as any  hazardous positions/locations that they \nneed to avoid. (See Sec.   1926.1404(d).) These requirements ensure that both the A/D director and  crew \nmembers understand the assembly/disassembly procedures t hat are  going to be undertaken.      C-DAC \ndeclined to require the procedures to be in writing and at  the site. In some cases, the procedures are not \ncomplex and are very  familiar to the A/D director. In such cases C -DAC determined that  having them in \nwriting is not necessary. In other cases, such as where  the procedures are complex, the equipment is new to \nthe employer, or  the A/D director has not often assembled/disassembled the equipment,  there is an \ninherent incentive for the employer to have them  in  writing. In such instances, OSHA expects that the \nemployer will have  written procedures on site to facilitate meeting the requirements in  Sec. Sec.  \n1926.1404(b) and (d). The Agency therefore finds that it is  not necessary to have a requirement that they be \nin writing and at the  site.     Lastly, a commenter suggested that this section incorporate by  reference \nthe ANSI/ASSE A10.31 American National Standard, Safety  Requirements, Definitions and Specifications for \nDigger Derricks. (ID- 0178.1.) Because the commenter did not explain how incorporating this  standard would \nmake the final rule more effective, OSHA has decided not  to incorporate ANSI/ASSE A10.31 into Sec.   \n1926.1403.     In the proposed rule, Sec.  1926.1404(n) set forth the requirement  (now set forth in this \nsection) that an employer must comply with  manufacturer prohibitions. The Agency decided that this \nimportant  caveat to Sec.  1926.1403 would be be tter understood if it was moved to  this section. Therefore, \nSec.  1926.1404(n) is now reserved and its  text is integrated in this section.      Additionally, OSHA has \nsubstituted an \"or\" in place of the  \"and\" separating \"assembling\" and \"disassembling\" t o clarify that  the \nlisted requirements apply when the employer is assembling or  disassembling. Finally, a reference to Sec.  \n1926.1404(r) has been  added to Sec.  1926.1403(b) to clarify when employer procedures may not  be used. \nSection 1926.1404 Assembly/Disassembly--General Requirements (Applies  to All Assembly and Disassembly \nOperations) Paragraph (a) Supervision --Competent--Qualified Person      Section 1926.1404(a) requires \nassembly/disassembly to be directed  by a person who meets the criteria for both a competent person and a  \nqualified person, or by a competent person who is assisted by one or  more qualified persons (\"A/D director\"). \nWhere the assembly/ disassembly is being performed by only one person, that person must  meet the criteria \nfor both a competent person and a qualified person.  For purposes of this standard, that person is considered \nthe A/D director.     Section 1926.1401 defines \"A/D director\" as \"an individual who  meets this standard's \nrequirements for an A/D director, irrespective of  the person's formal job title or whether the person is non-\nmanagement  or management personnel.\"",

This provision is included to help ensure that  the \noperator has the information necessary to verify that the load is  within the rated capacity of the equipment.     \nOne commenter suggested that this secti on be amended to  specifically include as a reliable source the \npersonal experience of  the operator with loads of similar size and materials. (ID-0232.1.)  OSHA rejects that \nsuggestion because it is not convinced by any  evidence in the record that all operators, regardless of whether \nthe  operator is experienced or has been on the job for a few weeks, are  capable of producing an accurate, \nreliable estimate of the load  weights. For example, an operator may have recently lifted precast  concrete \nsections that, based on date provided by the manufacturer,  weighed 5 tons each. The operator may be called \nupon to lift other  precast concrete sections of unknown weight that ar e actually 10%  heavier than those \nlifted earlier. It is unlikely that the heavier  sections would be significantly different in appearance than those \nthat  weigh 10% less, and the operator may mistakenly underestimate the  weight of the sections if \npermitted to estimate load weight based on  his or her personal experience with loads of similar size.      \nParagraph (o)(3)(ii) establishes an alternative procedure that does  not require the employer to determine the \nactual weight of the load  under certain circumstances. Under paragraph (o)(3)(ii), the operator  would have \nto begin hoisting the load to determine if it exceeds 75  percent of the maximum rated capacity at the longest \nradius that will  be used during the lift operation, using a load weighing device, load  moment indicator, rated \ncapacity indicator, or rated capacity limiter.  If the load does not exceed 75 percent of the maximum rated \ncapacity,  the lift can be conducted without determining the weight of the load.  This verification procedure \n\\87\\ incorporates a sufficient margin of  error and would be adequate to ensure that the crane's rated capacity  \nwill not be exceeded. If, however, the load does exceed 75 percent of  the maximum rated capacity, then the \noperator may not proceed with the  lift until he/she verifies the weight of the load in accordance with  Sec.  \n1926.1417(o)(3)(i). No comments were received on this paragraph,  and it is promulgated without change \nfrom the proposed rule.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\87\\ The operator \nwould still be required to use his or her  professional judgment in determining whether the load exceeds the  \ncapacity of the equipment. As discussed above, proposed Sec.   1926.1417 (k) would prohibit sole reliance by \nthe operator on an  operational aid, such as a load weight device, for ensuring that the  equipment's capacity \nwill not be exceeded. The procedure in proposed  Sec.  1926.1417(o)(3)(ii) is a verification procedure --it \nwould  verify that the operator's estimate is at least correct in terms of  not exceeding 75% of the \nequipment's rated capacity (at the longest  radius that will be used). If, for examp le, the load weight device  \nyields a figure that is significantly below what the operator  estimates to be the true weight, the operator \nwould need to reliably  determine the weight of the load before proceeding with the lift. --------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------  Paragraph (p)     This paragraph requires that the boom or other \nparts of the  equipment not contact any obstruction. No comments were submitted on  this paragraph, and \nit is promulgated as proposed. Paragraph (q)     This paragraph requires that the equipment not be used to \ndrag or  pull loads sideways. This is to prevent the sideloading that occurs  when a load is dragged or pulled \nsideways. Sideloading can buckle the  boom, damage the swing mechanism, or ov erturn the crane (such as \nwhen  the boom is at a high angle). No comments were submitted on this  paragraph, and it is promulgated \nas proposed.  Paragraph (r)     Paragraph (r) of this section applies to wheel -mounted equipment  and \nrequires that no loads be lifted over the front area, except as  permitted by the manufacturer. Wheel-mounted \nequipment typically is not  designed to lift loads over the front area. Equipment that is not so  designed will \nlikely tip over or otherwise fail when lifting loads over  the front area. If the equipment is specifically designed",

Paragraph \n(e)(2), as renumbered in the final rule, now requires  that all equipment with a rotating superstructure have a \npositive crane  house lock. This device is necessary for equipment covered within  this  section because it \npositively locks the rotating superstructure. The  lock provides additional protection from the superstructure's  \naccidental movement that can result due to the action of wind, waves,  or current.     Because the speed \nand directi on of the wind can directly affect  equipment operations, such as by diminishing equipment \ncapacity and  inducing unintended movement of the load, Sec.  1926.1437(e)(3)  requires equipment \ncovered by this section to have and use a wind speed  and direction indicator when a competent person \ndetermines that wind is  a factor that needs to be considered during operations.      OSHA received no \ncomments on proposed paragraphs (e)(1)-(e)(4), and  is retaining all of these provisions in the final rule, except \nfor the  requirement of a horn and with renumbering, because they improve the  safety of the vessels, and, \ntherefore, the safety of the employee  involved in crane/derrick operations onboard the vessel.

A witness  who appeared on \nbehalf of the commenter at the public hearing,  testified that cranes are typically used on a residential \nconstruction  project between two and six hours to lift objects like roof and floor  trusses. (ID-0341.) The \nwitness noted that for commercial construction,  a crane might be on the job from six months to two years. \n(ID-0341.) In  light of the brief percentage of time cranes are used in residential  construction compared to \nthe percentage of time they are used in  commercial construction, it would be expected that the percentage \nof  accidents they cause will similarly be lower even if, while they are on  the job, they present the same or \neven a higher degree of risk. \\112\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\112\\ Mr. \nBehlman testified that overhead power lines are \"very  seldom\" found on residential sites. (ID-0341.) However, \nthe  document on NAHB's Web site showing the causes of residential  construction fatalities from 2003 to \n2006 attributes 76 fatalities  to \"contact with overhead power lines.\" ----------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------      OSHA also rejects the commenter's suggestion that homebuilders  should be \npermitted to self-certify their crane operators. The  commenter states that the vast majority of the building \nassociation's  single-family home builders are very small, with 61% building ten homes  or fewer. The witness \nstated at the hearing that the home building  industry has many small operations and a few very large players. \n(ID- 0341.) In OSHA's experience, most small construction firms would not  have the expertise to develop or \nadminister the types of tests  necessary to reliably assess operator ability (see the discussion of  the criteria \napplied by nationally recognized accrediting entities to  accredit certification organizations).     OSHA also \ndoes not conclude that such companies typically possess  the expertise to establish and implement the \nsophisticated type of  training program that the commenter suggests should be required for  employer self-\ncertification. (ID-0232.1.) The same problem e xists  throughout the construction industry, which includes \nnumerous small  firms. Furthermore, as found by C -DAC, independent testing is essential  to ensure that \noperators have in fact attained the knowledge and  ability the training is supposed to impart.     A number \nof commenters suggested that the proposed requirements  should be modified in various ways. Some \nsuggested exempting certain  equipment from the qualification/certification requirement or requiring  a \nform of qualification/certification tha t the employer could implement  without resort to third -party \nverification. Others suggested expanding  the range of options available to the employer, in particular allowing  \naccredited educational institutions to certify operators. These  comments will b e discussed below in the \nsections of the standard that  address the issues raised by the commenters.  Paragraph (a)     In the final \nrule, paragraph (a) of this section specifies that the  employer must ensure that the operator of any equipment \ncovered under  Sec.  1926.1400, with certain listed exceptions, is either qualified or  certified to operate \nthe equipment in accordance with the provisions of  this section or is operating the equipment during a \ntraining period.  Paragraph (a)(1) requires compliance with State and local operator  licensing laws. For areas \nwhere State or local licensing is not  required, paragraph (a)(2) requires employers to use one of the three  \noptions listed above to certify or qualify their operators. Paragraph  (a)(3) provides exceptions from all of Sec.  \n1926.1427's certification  and qualification requirements for operators of certain equipment,  regardless of \nwhether State or local governments have licensing  requirements for operators of that equipment.\\113\\ ------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------      \\113\\ These State and local licensing requirements \nwould remain  in effect. See discussion of preemption of State and local law under  federalism in section V.D \nof this preamble. OSHA is simply choosing  not to require compliance with any such licensing requirements",

Another commenter \nconfirmed  that most non-freshwater vessels have permanently sealed hatches. (ID- 0344.1.)     Under this \nprovision, as proposed, a competent person must inspect  the vessel for \"taking on water\" and does not \nspecify any particular  method for making this determination. As one commenter suggested,  measuring \nfreeboards is a way to determine if a vessel is listing more  than a couple of degrees and, therefore, possibly \ntaking on water. (ID- 0344.1.) The requirement here is for the competent person to use an  effective means of \ndetermining if the vessel is t aking on water, which  can vary depending on the type of vessel.      With \nrespect to Sec.  1926.1437(h)(2)(iv), a commenter was  concerned that the requirement to check the \"fuel \ncompartments * * *  for serviceability as a water -tight appliance\" included a n expectation  that the hatch \ncover would be removed to inspect the fuel compartment.  (ID-0345.26.) The commenter further stated the \nusual means of checking  for water in a fuel tank is by using a plumb bob and clear coat that  changes color \nif water is present. The proposed provision requires a  competent person to inspect the fuel compartments, \namong other areas,  for \"serviceability as a water -tight appliance.\" The provision does  not specify any \nparticular method for making this determination,  provided the competent person uses an effective method \nfor doing so.      Based on the need to ensure the integrity of the vessel/flotation  device for employee \nsafety, and the availability o f nonintrusive means  of determining this integrity, OSHA is retaining Sec. Sec.   \n1926.1437(h)(2)(ii) and 1926.1437(h)(2)(iv) in the final rule. OSHA  received no comments on the remaining \nprovisions proposed for  paragraphs (h)(2) and (h)(3) and OSHA is retaining these provisions to  ensure that \nvessels/flotation devices used for crane/derrick operations  remain safe for employees, and that the employer \ncorrects deficiencies  in the vessels/flotation devices that are hazardous to employees.      Under Sec.   \n1926.1437(h), inspections are required at four distinct  times: Each shift, each month, annually, and every four \nyears. As  specified in paragraph (h)(3), a competent person must conduct the  shift and monthly inspections. \nIf the competent person identif ies a  deficiency, an immediate determination by a qualified person is then  \nrequired to ascertain if the deficiency constitutes a hazard. If the  deficiency constitutes a hazard, the vessel \nmust be removed from  service until the deficiency is corrected.     These requirements differ from the shift \nand monthly general  inspection requirements of Sec.  1926.1412, in which the competent  person who \nidentifies a deficiency then determines whether the  deficiency is a safety hazard requiring immediate \ncorrection. The  reason for this difference is that the equipment covered under this  section is highly \nspecialized and therefore requires a high level of  knowledge.     With respect to the annual inspections, \nSec.  1926.1437(h)(4)  requires the equipment and vessel/flotation device to be inspected by a  qualified \nperson with expertise with respect to vessels/flotation  devices. The Agency concludes it is important to state \nexplicitly that  the qualified person conducting these inspections must have the  necessary expertise for the \nitems listed for the annual inspection with  respect to barges, pontoons, vessels or other means of flotation.  \nAccordingly, OSHA is retaining the provision in the final rule.      The qualified person required for the shift \nand monthly inspections  must have expertise with respect to the work conditions, the crane/ derrick, and the \nvessel/flotation device. However, the annual  inspection is more extensive than the shift or monthly \ninspections.",

Finally, the OSH A ct \nrequires that, when promulgating a rule that  differs substantially from a national consensus standard, OSHA \nmust  explain why the promulgated rule is a better method for effectuating  the purpose of the Act. 29 U.S.C. \n655(b)(8). Deviations from relevan t  consensus standards are explained elsewhere in this preamble.   B. \nExecutive Summary of the Final Economic Analysis; Final Regulatory  Flexibility Analysis  1. Introduction and \nSummary     For the final Cranes and Derricks standard, the Agency is  presenting this Executive Summary \nof the Final Economic Analysis (FEA)  in this preamble; while the full FEA will be available in the docket.  The \ncomplete Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis  is also presented  here.     The Occupational Safety and \nHealth Act of 1970 (OSH Act) requires  OSHA to demonstrate the technological and economic feasibility of its  \nrules. Executive Order (E.O.) 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act  (RFA), as amende d in 1996, require \nFederal agencies to analyze the  costs, benefits, and other consequences and impacts, including small  \nbusiness impacts, of their rules.      The final cranes standard is an economically significant action  under \nE.O. 12866 and a major ru le under the Congressional Review Act  (SBREFA). In addition, as required by the \nRFA, the Agency has assessed  the potential impacts of this final rule on small entities and has  prepared a \nFinal Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. This rule is not a  significant Federal intergovernmental mandate, and the \nAgency has no  obligations to conduct analyses of this rule under the Unfunded  Mandates Reform Act of \n1995; however the rule has costs of over $100  million per year on the private sector, and is thus subjec t to \nthe  requirement under UMRA for review of private-sector costs. These  requirements are met in this section.     \nThe purpose of the Final Economic Analysis is to identify the  establishments and industries affected by the \nfinal standard; evaluate  the standard's costs, benefits, and economic impacts; assess the  technological and \neconomic feasibility of the final standard for  affected industries; and evaluate the appropriateness of \nregulatory and  non-regulatory alternatives to the rule. The FEA has been developed  according to the \nrequirements of E.O. 12866 and the OSH Act. In  addition, in accordance with the RFA as amended b y the \nSBREFA, this  analysis identifies and estimates the impacts of the proposal on small  businesses, using the \nSmall Business Administration's (SBA's) industry - specific definitions of small businesses. In addition, OSHA \nassessed  the impacts of the rul e on very small businesses; i.e., those with  fewer than 20 employees.      \nThe FEA differs in several respects from the preliminary economic  analysis (PEA). Several affected general \nindustry sectors have been  added to the original analysis, based on comm ent during the  rulemaking--for \nexample, electric utilities, telecommunications, sign  manufacturers, natural gas pipelines, and shipyards--an \nestimated  22,000 potentially affected establishments in all. Costs have been  revised for employer duties for \nassembly/disassembly and ground  conditions, power line work, and crane operator certification, as well  as \ninspections (due to an error in the PEA). New costs have been  estimated for meeting ground conditions' \nprovisions ($2.3 million  annually). Estimated costs for assembly/disassembly have been decreased  in this \nfinal analysis, from about $33 million annually in the PEA to  about $16 million, primarily due to an increase \nin current compliance  (baseline) and estimated costs also fell for inspections (from $21  million annually to \n$16.5 million).",

May 7, 2004: One fatality. An employee, \na rigger/operator-in- training, was in the upper cab of a 60 -ton hydraulic boom-truck crane  to set up and \nposition the crane boom prior to a lift. The crane was  equipped with two hoists --a main line and auxiliary.  \nThe main hoist  line had a multi-sheave block and hook and the auxiliary line had a 285  pound ball and hook. \nWhen the employee extended the hydraulic boom, a  two-block condition occurred with the auxiliary line ball \nstriking the  auxiliary sheave head a nd knocking the sheave and ball from the boom.  The employee was \nstruck in the head by the falling ball. (ID -0017.8.)     This type of accident will be prevented by Sec.  \n1926.1416,  Operational aids, which requires protection against two -blocking. A  hydraulic boom crane, if \nmanufactured after February 28, 1992, must be  equipped with a device that automatically prevents two -\nblocking.     Also, the final rule, under Sec.  1926.1427(a) and (f), prohibits  an operator-in-training from \noperating a crane without being monitored  by a trainer, and without first having sufficient training to enable  \nthe operator-in-training to perform the ass igned task safely.     13. April 26, 2006: One fatality. A framing \ncrew was installing  sheathing for a roof. A crane was hoisting a bundle of plywood  sheathing to a location \non the roof. As the crane positioned the bundle  of sheathing above its landing location, the load hoist on the \ncrane  free spooled, causing an uncontrolled descent of the load. An employee  was under the load preparing \nto position the load to its landing spot  when the load fell and crushed him. (ID -0017.9.)     Section \n1926.1426, Free fall and controlled load lowering, will  prevent this type of accident. This section prohibits \nfree fall of the  load-line hoist, and requires controlled lowering of the load when an  employee is directly \nunder the load.      As discussed later in the se ction titled, Executive Summary of the  Final Economic \nAnalysis; Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, OSHA  finds that construction workers suffer 89 fatal injuries per \nyear from  the types of equipment covered by this final standard. Of that number,  OSHA estimates that 21 \nfatalities would be avoided by compliance with  the final standard. In addition, OSHA estimates that the final \nstandard  would prevent 175 non-fatal injuries each year. Based on its review of  all the available evidence, \nOSHA finds tha t construction workers have a  significant risk of death and injury resulting from equipment  \noperations, and that the risk would be substantially reduced by  compliance with this final standard.     The \nOSH Act requires OSHA to make certain findings with respect to  standards. One of these findings, specified \nby Section 3(8) of the OSH  Act, requires an OSHA standard to address a significant risk and to  reduce this \nrisk substantially. (See UAW v. OSHA, 37 F.3d 665, 668 (DC  Cir. 1994) (\"LOTO\").) As discussed in Section II of \nthis preamble,  OSHA finds that crane and derrick operations in construction constitute  a significant risk and \nestimates that the final standard will prevent  22 fatalities and 175 injuries annually. Section 6(b) of the OSH \nAct  requires OSHA to determine if its standards are technologically and  economically feasible. As discussed \nin Section V of this preamble, OSHA  finds that this final standard is economically and technologically  \nfeasible.     The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C 601, as amended) requires  that OSHA determine \nwhether a standard will have a significant economic  impact on a substantial number of small firms. As \ndiscussed in Section  V, OSHA examined the small firms affected by this standard and  certifies that the final \nstandard will not have a significant impact on  a substantial number of small firms.",

As  explained in the discussion of \nSec.  1926.1419(b) in the preamble to  the proposed rule, C-DAC included Sec.  1926.1419(d) to allow for \nthe  development of new signals in the future (see 73 FR 59796 -59797, Oct.  9, 2008). To ensure that any \nnew signals developed by a particular  employer are as effective as hand, voice, or audible signals,  Sec. Sec.  \n1926.1419(d)(1) and (d)(2) require the employer to  demonstrate that the new signals are as effective as \nexisting signals  for communicating. Alternatively, an employer may use signals that  comply with a national \nconsensus standard. \\96\\ OSHA decided to change  the language of paragraph (d)(2) to clarify that an \nemployer's signals  must comply with the national consensus standard signals. C -DAC  determined it was \nappropriate to allow reliance on signals in a  national consensus standard because their inclusion in such a \nstandard  shows a high degree of standardization and widespread acceptance by  persons who are affected \nby the signals, thereby ensuring that the  signals can be used safely to control equipment operations and  \npreventing the \"on the fly\" development of signals cited as dangerous  by the commenter. (ID-0110.1.) --------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------      \\96\\ The C -DAC draft refers to an \"industry \nconsensus  standard.\" OSHA has changed this to \"national consensus standard\"  to conform to the \nterminology used in the OSH Act. See definition in  section 3(9) of the Act. ---------------------------------------------\n------------------------------  Paragraph (e) Suitability     Under paragraph (e) of this section, the type of signal \n(hand,  voice, audible, or new) and the transmission method used must be  suitable for the site conditions. \nFor example, hand signals would not  be suitable if site conditions do not allow for the signal person to be  \nwithin the operator's line of sight. Radio signals would not be  suitable if electronic interference on the site \nprohibits the signals  from being readily understood.     One commenter requested that the determination \nof which type and  means of signaling is appropriate for the site conditions be made by  the crane operator \nor other qualified person. (ID-0172.1.)     The Agency concludes that this is a straight-forward determination  \nthat does not require the specialized expertise of a qualified person.  Also, the crane operator will typically be \ninvolved in this  determination, since there are several requirements relating to  effective communication \nthat, as a practical matter, will typically  involve input from the operator (see, for example, Sec. Sec.   \n1926.1419(f), 1926.1420(a), and 1926.1421(c)).  Paragraph (f)     Paragraph (f) of this section requires the \nability to transmit  signals between the operator and signal person to be maintained. If  that ability is \ninterrupted, the operator is required to safely stop  operations until signal transmission is reestablished and a \nproper  signal is given and understood. No comments were received on this  provision; it is included in the \nfinal rule without change. Paragraph (g)     As explained in the preamble to the proposed rule, paragraph (g) \nof  this section requires the operator to stop operations if the operator  becomes aware of a safety problem \nand needs to communicate with the  signal person (see 73 FR 59797, Oct. 9, 2008). Operations may only be  \nresumed after the operator and signal person agree that the problem has  been resolved.     No comments \nwere received on this provision; it is included in the  final rule without change.  Paragraphs (h) and (j)      \nParagraph (h) of this section requires that only one person at a  time signal the operator. As explained in the \npreamble to the proposed  rule, C-DAC determined this provision was needed to prevent confusion  with \nrespect to which signals the operator is supposed to follow (see  73 FR 59797, Oct. 9, 2008). An exception is \nprovided in Sec.   1926.1419(j) to address situations when somebody becomes aware of a  safety problem \nand gives an emergency stop signal. Under Sec.   1926.1417(y), the operator is required to obey such a signal.",

Using a crane for such purpose would be particularly usefu l  in many \nsituations, especially where establishing a suitable anchor  point would be otherwise very difficult. OSHA \nasked C-DAC to consider  whether there is any reason to prohibit using a crane or derrick for  such purpose. \nC-DAC determined that the hoo k or load line of a crane  could be used safely as an anchor point under the \nconditions set forth  in paragraph (j). \\103\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \n\\103\\ OSHA modified the language from the proposed rule so that  final paragraph (j) of this section refers to \na \"personal fall  arrest system\" rather than a \"fall arrest system.\" This  modification was made for the purpose \nof clarity to use the terms  defined in Sec.  1926.1401, Definitions, and to maintain  consistency  in the \nconstruction standards.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      Paragraph (j)(1) \nallows the hook or load line to be used as an  anchorage point when a qualified person has determined that \nthe se t-up  and rated capacity of the crane/derrick (including the hook, load line  and rigging) meets or \nexceeds the requirements in Sec.   1926.502(d)(15). C-DAC concluded that, as long as the crane or derrick  \nhas sufficient capacity to meet those criteria, there is no reason to  prohibit its use for this purpose.     C-\nDAC did conclude, however, that the expertise of a qualified  person is required to determine whether specific \ncriteria are met when  anchoring to the hook or load line. The criteria in Sec.   1926.502(d)(15) were \ndeveloped to ensure that fall protection  anchorages provide adequate employee protection. Anchorages \nused for  personal fall arrest systems must be capable of supporting at least  5,000 pounds or designed, \ninstalled, and used as part of a complete  personal fall arrest system which maintains a safety factor of at least  \ntwo. A number of factors related to the crane's capacity in the  particular configuration and set-up involved \nwould need to be  considered, including, in some cases, the angle of the fall arrest  lanyard to the boom if a \nfall were to occur. In addition, the qualified  person would need to determine whether the set-up is such that \nit would  not cause an equipment failure, s uch as a broken cable or chain, for  the load line to serve as an \nanchorage for a personal fall arrest  system. These determinations necessarily would include consideration of  \nthe characteristics of the particular equipment involved and the  limitations of its operation. OSHA agrees that \na qualified person must  determine whether the criteria are met, and has included that  requirement in \nparagraph (j)(1).     Paragraph (j)(2) requires that the equipment operator be at the  work site and informed \nthat the equipment is being used to anchor a  personal fall arrest system. This would ensure that the operator \nis  available to make any necessary adjustments, such as moving the boom or  load lines. Further, in the event \nof an emergency that results in a  tied-off employee being suspended from the hook or load line, the  \noperator would be available to bring the worker to the ground safely.     OSHA received three comments on \nthe provisions relating to  anchoring to the load line, and one member of the public submitted  written \ntestimony on the provisions prior to the hearing on the  proposed rule. Two of the commenters responded \npositively to the  provisions (ID-0155.1; -0203.1) and one commenter stated the provisions  were a necessary \nimprovement that would allow employers to provide fall  protection in the narrow circumstances where there \nare no viable  options other than the crane hook (ID-0203.1).     The third commenter was opposed to the \nprovisions and stated that  anchoring to the load line should be prohibited. (ID -0178.1.) This  commenter \nstated that cranes are only engineered to lift straight up  and straight down and that retracting a hook at any \nother angle may jam  or break the cable or chain, which would result in a dropped load. OSHA  concludes \nparagraph (j) addresses this concern for the reasons  discussed below.     Written testimony submitted \nprior to the hearing expressed the  concern that, under Sec.  1926.1417(e), which allows a suspended load",

Paragraph (d) Keeping Clear of the Load      Paragraph (d) of this section states that the \nrequirements of Sec.   1926.1425, Keeping clear of the load, do not apply to the equipment  covered by Sec.  \n1926.1437. Due to the limited space available for  equipment on worksites covered by this section (i.e., the \ndecks of  barges and other vessels), the requirements of Sec.  1926.1425 are  infeasible under these \nworksite conditions , in the experience of C -DAC.  OSHA received no comments on this provision, and, \ntherefore, is  promulgating it in the final rule as proposed because it strikes a  balance between the \npracticalities of the worksite and safety for  employees. Other provisions within this section provide other \nmeans of  protecting employees in the unique worksites covered by this section.  Paragraph (e) Additional \nSafety Devices     Paragraph (e) of this section lists additional safety devices  required for equipment \ncovered by this section. Equipment covered by  Sec.  1926.1437 is required to have the safety devices listed \nin Sec.   1926.1415, Safety devices, unless otherwise not ed in Sec.  1926.1415.  The additional safety \ndevices required by Sec.  1926.1437(e) address  the special conditions of a marine worksite, especially with \nrespect to  vessel stability, inadvertent movement due to water conditions, and the  greater effect of wind \nand other environmental conditions on equipment  operating at these sites. However, note that Sec.  \n1926.1415 excepts  floating cranes/derricks and land cranes/derricks on barges, pontoons,  vessels, or other \nmeans of flotation from having crane level indicators  and floating cranes from having foot pedal brake locks. \n(See the  discussion above under Sec. Sec.  1926.1415(a)(1)(iii) and  1926.1415(a)(4) for an explanation of \nthese exceptions.)     Paragraph (e)(1) requires equipment covered by this section to have  a list and trim \ndevice. It is necessary to have this device since the  degrees of list and trim are directly related to the stability \nof the  vessel/flotation device and therefore to the stability of the equipment  and its safe operation.      \nProposed paragraph (e)(2) required equipment covered in this  section to have a horn. In the experience of C-\nDAC, the sounding of the  equipment's horn is commonly understood in the marine industry as a way  to \nwarn employees about the presence of or movement of the equipment or  its load. In the final rule, OSHA has \nadded the requirement of a horn  to the general list of safety devices required in Sec.  1926.1415. See  Sec.  \n1926.1415(a)(7). As noted above, the requirements of Sec.   1926.1415 apply to floating cranes/derricks, so \nrestating the  requirement in Sec.  1926.1437(e)(2) would be redundant. OSHA is  therefore removing the \nhorn requirement from this section and  renumbering the remainder of Sec.  1926.1437(e).      Paragraph \n(e)(2), as renumbered in the final rule, now requires  that all equipment with a rotating superstructure have a \npositive crane  house lock. This device is necessary for equipment covered within  this  section because it \npositively locks the rotating superstructure. The  lock provides additional protection from the superstructure's  \naccidental movement that can result due to the action of wind, waves,  or current.     Because the speed \nand directi on of the wind can directly affect  equipment operations, such as by diminishing equipment \ncapacity and  inducing unintended movement of the load, Sec.  1926.1437(e)(3)  requires equipment \ncovered by this section to have and use a wind speed  and direction indicator when a competent person \ndetermines that wind is  a factor that needs to be considered during operations.",
    "6d6297f8-93f6-44c9-bea5-3b724c6e817a": "page_label: 254\nfile_name: OSHA-Final Rule-Cleaned.pdf\nfile_path: C:\\Users\\bs44876\\Desktop\\Project\\CII-Crane\\FineEmb\\dataset\\data\\OSHA-Final Rule-Cleaned.pdf\nfile_type: application/pdf\nfile_size: 3496317\ncreation_date: 2025-01-07\nlast_modified_date: 2025-01-07\n\nregistered professional engineer specify the equipment configurations  to which it applies. Cranes typically \ncan be configured in a variety of  ways. Modifications may have different effects depending on the  \nconfiguration. C-DAC determined that it was essential for purposes of  ensuring safe operation that the \napproval specify the configurations to  which it applies. An example of an approval satisfying this would be  \nthe following: \"This is an approval to add an additional boom section  of the above -described design for a \nbrand K lattice boom crane, model  1. This approval applies only when the crane is configured without a  jib.\"     \nParagraph (a)(2)(i)(B) requires that the registered professional  engineer modify load charts, procedures, \ninstruction manuals, and  instruction plates/ tags/decals as necessary to accord with the  \nmodification/addition. Under paragraph (a)(2)(ii), the original safety  factor of the equipment must not be \nreduced.     One local jurisdiction commented that local governments should have  the option of reviewing \nand approving cranes that are not modified in  conjunction with the manufacturer. (ID -0156.1.) The \ncommenter did not  explain how such a requirement would work in practice or how it would  enhance \nemployee safety. OSHA defers to C-DAC's judgment that having a  registered professional engineer (who is a \nqualified person with  respect to the equipment involved) approve the modification in  accordance with the \nrequirements of paragraph (a)(2) will provide  adequate protection. See, e.g., Building & Constr. Trades Dep't, \nAFL- CIO v. Brock, 838 F.2d 1258, 1271 (DC Cir. 1988) (\"[A] party  challenging an OSHA standard must bear the \nburden of demonstrating that  the variations it advocates will * * * provide more than a de minimis  benefit. \n* * *\"). Paragraph (a)(2) is adopted without change from the  proposal. Option (3)--Unavailable Manufacturer     \nParagraph (a)(3) addresses a scenario in which the manufacturer  of  equipment is unavailable to review \nproposed modifications/additions  because, for example, it has gone out of business (and has not been  \ntaken over by a successor company). In this situation, if the employer  wishes to modify its equipment in a \nway that affects its capacity or  safe operation, it can get approval from a registered professional  engineer \nin accordance with the requirements of (a)(2)(i) and (ii)  above. This paragraph is adopted as proposed. Option \n(4)--Manufacturer Does Not Complete the Review Within 120 Days  of the Request     Paragraph (a)(4) has \nbeen added to this section of the final rule  based on a particular scenario raised by a commenter where a  \nmanufacturer agrees to review a proposed modification/addition, but  fails to complete that review within \n120 days of the date on which it  was provided with a detailed description of the proposed modification/  \naddition. (ID-0187.1.) OSHA agrees with the commenter that in that  scenario the employer should have the \noption of seeking approval from a  registered professional engineer in accordance with the requirements of  \n(a)(2)(i) and (ii) above. OSHA concludes that 120 days will generally  be sufficient for manufacturers to \ncomplete reviews; for proposed  modifications/additions that are particularly extensive or complex,  OSHA \nassumes that the length of time needed to review the proposal will  be longer and will be addressed as a \ncontractual matter between the  parties. Option (5)--Multiple Manufacturers of Equipment Designed for Use \non  Marine Work Sites     Paragraph (a)(5) has been added to this final rule in response to a  comment \nregarding equipment used on marine work sites. (ID -0187.1.)  According to this commenter, in the marine \nconstruction industry,  contractors routinely hire shipyards to build specialized barges or  modify existing \nbarges used as floating platforms for hoisting  equipment. Custom -made hoisting equipment for such \noperations is  frequently assembled using component parts manufactured by multiple  manufacturers and \nthen installed on the floating platform. In such  cases, it is impossible to identify a single \"manufacturer\" from  \nwhich to seek approval for a modification/addition; therefore OSHA  concludes that it was reasonable to \nprovide employers in these  instances with the ability to seek approval for a proposed  modification/addition",

The Committee concluded and OSHA \nagrees that these  electrocution warnings are necessary to protect the operator as well as  any employees \nworking in the area around the crane by increasing their  awareness of the hazard. This provision is similar to \nsec. 5 -3.4.5.2(d)  of ASME B30.5 -2004. No adverse comments were received on this provision;  it is \npromulgated as proposed.

It also \nrequested that the owner maintain these  documents for the life of the equipment and transfer them from \nowner to  owner when sold.     OSHA determines the documentation described by the commenter would  \nbe burdensome for the user and owner of the equipment, with no added,  industry-recognized, benefit to safe \nhoisting operations. There is no  significant, safety -related evidence in the record to substantiate the  \ndocumentation requirements the commenter recommended. Therefore, O SHA is not  requiring \ndocumentation of the shift inspection.      The SBREFA Panel recommended that OSHA solicit public \ncomment on  whether, and under what circumstances, booming down should be  specifically excluded as a \npart of the shift inspection, and w hether  the removal of non -hinged inspection plates should be required \nduring  the shift inspection. Section 1926.1413(a)(1), discussed below,  explicitly states that booming down \nis not required as part of the  shift inspection for wire rope. C-DAC did not include a similar  provision in the \ngeneral shift inspection provision in Sec.   1926.1412(d) because booming down is not required to observe a  \ndeficiency in any of the items requiring inspection under that  paragraph. Similarly, OSHA determines that \ninspection for a deficiency  in any of those items does not require the removal of non -hinged  inspection \nplates.     Several commenters submitted comments that indicated a need for  OSHA to clarify that it is not \nusually necessary to boom down to  complete a visual inspection of the items listed in Sec.  1926.1412(d).  \n(ID-0143.1; -0205; -0213.) In response to the apparent ambiguity  suggested indicated by these comments, \nOSHA is revising Sec.   1926.1412(d)(1), to clarify that booming down is not required  routinely. The term \n\"disassembly\" was replaced with \"taking apart  equipment component\" in paragraph (d)(1) of this section to \navoid any  confusion as to whether the provision was addressing disassembly as  defined for the application \nof Sec. Sec.  1926.1403 through 1926.1406.      Paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (xiv) set forth the list of items  \nthat, at a minimum, a competent person must insp ect each shift.  Paragraph (d)(1)(x) of the proposed rule \nlisted \"[g]round conditions  around the equipment for proper support, including ground settling  under and \naround outriggers and supporting foundations, ground water  accumulation, or similar condit ions.\"     A \nrailroad association objected to the application of this  provision to railroads. (ID -0170.1.) The association \ncommented that the  Sec.  1926.1412(d)(1)(x) requirement that an inspector verify the  ground conditions \naround the equipment before each shift makes no sense  for a crane moving down the track. OSHA notes that \nthis provision does  not require a railroad to inspect the ground conditions along the track  if a railroad crane \nis simply traveling down the track. Section  1926.1402, which contains requirements for ground conditions, \nmakes  clear that the conditions being addressed are those where the equipment  is operating. To the extent \nthat a railroad crane may move down the  track during a construction operation, OSHA determines it is  \nappropriate to require the ground conditions along the track to be  inspected to ensure that no hazardous \nconditions, such as the erosion  or other physical degradations of the support for railways, have  developed \nthat will adversely affect the support nee ded for equipment  to perform safely during hoisting operations. \nHowever, OSHA is adding  language to exempt railroad tracks and their underlying support from  inspection \nwhen those rails are regulated by the FRA. OSHA concludes  that the exemption is appropriate because the \nFRA already regulates the  ground conditions for railroad tracks, including specific regulations  addressing \nthe inspection of those rails and their support. See, e.g.,  49 CFR 213.233 (track inspections) and 213.237 \n(inspection of rail).  For consistency and clarity, OSHA is adding similar language exempting  rails regulated \nby the FRA to paragraph (d )(1)(xiii).     A crane rental company objected to the requirement to inspect",

However, as  explained in the proposed rule, this provision was not intended to  exclude \nmechanics' trucks when used to hoist materials during  construction work bu t only to provide a limited \nexception when they are  used for equipment maintenance and repair activities. Their use in this  manner is \nsimilar to the way automotive wreckers and tow trucks, which  are excluded under paragraph (c)(3) of this \nsection, are u sed. OSHA  determines that this exclusion should be limited in the manner stated in  the \nproposed rule, and paragraph (c)(9) is promulgated as proposed.      In proposed paragraph (c)(10), \nmachinery that hoists by using a  come-a-long or chainfall was excluded for the reasons explained in the  \npreamble to the proposed rule (see 73 FR 59730, Oct. 9, 2008). No  comments were received on this provision, \nand it is promulgated as  proposed.     Proposed paragraph (c)(11) excluded  dedicated drilling rigs. This  \nexclusion received substantial attention during the C -DAC negotiations  and was discussed at length in the \nproposed rule (see 73 FR 59730, Oct.  9, 2008). OSHA requested public comment on issues related to this  \nexclusion. No written comments were submitted but, in testimony at the  public hearing, a trade association \nsupported the proposed exclusion.  (ID-0341.) Accordingly, paragraph (c)(11) is promulgated as proposed.      \nProposed paragraph (c)(12) excluded \"gin poles when used for the  erection of communication towers.\" (See \ndiscussion at 73 FR 59730,  Oct. 9, 2008). A commenter stated that this exclusion should be  extended to also \ncover gin poles used to erect electrical transmission  towers and lines, but gave no suppor ting rationale or \ninformation. (ID- 0209.1.)     The use of gin poles for erecting communications towers is highly  specialized; \nthe communication tower industry has developed a detailed  consensus standard that specifically addresses \ntheir use in that  application.\\5\\ However, the Agency is unaware of a similar degree of  specialization and \ndevelopment of safe practices for gin poles used for  erecting electrical transmission towers. Accordingly, \nOSHA lacks a  basis for extending the exclusion to work othe r than that covered in  proposed paragraph \n(c)(12); paragraph (c)(12) is promulgated as  proposed with the addition of the word \"when\" before \"used\" to  \nclarify that the exclusion does not apply when gin poles previously  used to erect communication towers are \nused for other purposes.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\5\\ See ANSI/TIA -\n1019 (2004), Structural Standards for Steel Gin  Poles Used for Installation of Antenna Towers and Antenna \nSupporting  Structures, which contains detailed provisions for installing and  using gin poles to erect \ncommunication towers. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      Proposed paragraph \n(c)(13) excluded tree trimming and tree removal  work from the scope of the proposed rule. One commenter \nfavored the  exclusion as written (ID-0040.1), but another suggested limiting the  exclusion to tree trimming \nperformed for  maintenance and including tree  trimming related to construction (ID -0172.1). The latter \ncommenter  stated that tree trimming related to construction is particularly  dangerous because the weight \nof the pick is uncertain and the ground  conditions to support the equipment may be inadequate.     C-DAC \nagreed to exclude tree trimming and removal because the vast  majority of the tree care industry's work does \nnot take place in  construction and is therefore governed by general industry standards.  OSHA continues to \nagree that this is a valid reason for the exclusion.  OSHA is promulgating paragraph (c)(13) as proposed.      \nProposed paragraph (c)(14) excluded anchor handling with a vessel  or barge using an affixed A -frame. Two \ncommenters suggested that the  vessels to which this paragraph pertains should be excluded even when  \nused for purposes other than anchor handling to avoid having the  vessels move in and out of coverage \ndepending on how they are used.  (ID-0376.1; -0383.1.) These commenters stated that such vessels are  \nsometimes used for dredging operations and suggested rewording the  exclusion to state: \"Anchor handling \nor dredge related operations with  a vessel or barge using an affixed A-frame.\"     OSHA is adopting these",

Consequently, for the proposed rule, OSHA modified the language  \nused by C -DAC and addressed lattice boom cranes and telescopic boom  cranes separately. Proposed Sec.  \n1926.1431(p)(2) requires employers,  when using lattice boom cranes, to clearly mark the cable used to hoist  \npersonnel at the point on the cable that allows the equipment operator  to stop hoisting in time to prevent \ntwo-blocking, or to use a spotter  to warn the operator in time to prevent two-blocking. When using  lattice \nboom cranes, in addition to marking the cable as above, a  spotter must also be used. (See the discussion of \nthe proposed  provision at 73 FR 59838, Oct. 9, 2008.)     In the preamble to the proposed rule, OSHA asked \nfor public comment  on this change to the C -DAC language, but no comments were received on  this issue. \nTherefore, the provision is promulgated as proposed.     Section 1926.1431(p)(3) requires the employer to \nfollow Sec. Sec.   1926.1431(b) through (n) when using a personnel platform to hoist  employees. Section \n1926.1431(a) does not apply because the employer is  not required to demonstrate that the other means of \naccess listed in  Sec.  1926.1431(a) are infeasible before being permitted to hoist  personnel during pile \ndriving operations. Demonstrating infeasibility  prior to using a personnel platform is not required because in \nmost  instances another means of access is not feasible for this operation.  No comments were received on \nthis provision; it is promulgated as  proposed.     Section 1926.1431(p)(4) establishes the requirements for \nuse of a  boatswain's chair instead of a personnel platform for hoisting  personnel.     Section \n1926.1431(p)(4)(i) identifies which of the provisions in  Sec. Sec.  1926.1431(a) -(o) apply when using a \nboatswain's chair in a  pile driving operation. For the applicable provisions, the phrase  \"boatswain's chair\" \nis substituted for either \"personnel platform\"  or \"platform.\"     The Sec.  1926.1431 paragraphs not listed \nin Sec.   1926.1431(p)(4)(i) do not apply wh en a boatswain's chair is used. This  is because those \nrequirements are either specifically applicable to  personnel platform design and use, or are otherwise not \nrelevant when  hoisting personnel in a pile driving operation.      Section 1926.1431(p)(4)(ii) requires the \nemployee to be hoisted in  a slow, controlled descent and ascent. This is to limit swinging or  sudden \nmovement of the boatswain's chair to prevent a fall from the  chair or impact with equipment or other \nstructures.     Section 1926.1431(p) (4)(iii) specifies that the employee in the  boatswain's chair use \npersonal fall arrest equipment, including a full  body harness. The fall arrest system must be attached to either \nthe  lower load block or the overhaul ball. The purpose of having the fall  protection equipment and tie off \npoint independent of the boatswain's  chair and rigging used to hoist the employee is twofold: it protects  \nthe employee from a sudden drop or fall due to failure of that  equipment and protects the employee when \naccessing and egressing the  boatswain's chair.     Section 1926.1431(p)(4)(iv) requires fall protection \nequipment to  comply with Sec.  1926.502, Fall  protection systems criteria and  practices. This ensures that \nthe fall protection equipment is  sufficient to safely arrest the employee's fall.      No comments were \nreceived on paragraphs (p)(4)(i) --(p)(4)(iv); they  are promulgated as proposed.      The C-DAC consensus \ndocument did not include provisions to require  a minimum strength for the boatswain's chair and to require \nthat only  one person be hoisted at a time, when using a boatswain's chair in pile  driving operations. As \nexplained in the preamble to the proposed rule,  the Agency determined these were unintended omissions \nby the Committee.",

OSHA \nalso notes that paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B) twice refers to power  line contact in the phrases \"other than power line \ncontact\" and  \"repair of wire rope that contacted an energized power line is also  prohibited.\" OSHA is \nconcerned that these phrases could be misleading  in a paragraph devoted to remedial steps for a Category I \ndeficiency,  as power line contact can never be a Category I deficiency. It is a  Category III deficiency that \nrequires immediate replacement of the  rope. To avoid any implication that power line contact could be a  \nCategory I deficiency and that a competent person could determine that  the rope does not constitute a safety \nhazard under paragraph (a)(4)(i),  OSHA is deleting the words in proposed paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B) referring  to \npower line contact.

In some cases a  crane operator may not be the driver of such \nequipment on the  construction site. Therefore, OSHA solicited comments on whether the  language \"crane \noperator\" used in proposed Sec.  1926. 1411(b)(4)  should be changed to \"driver\" or \"driver/operator.\" The \ntwo  commenters who addressed this issue supported changing the language to  \"driver/operator.\" (ID-\n0205.1; -0213.1.) Therefore, this change to  the regulatory text has been made in the final rule.     Section \n1926.1411(b)(5) requires the employer to ensure that, when  traveling at night or in conditions of poor \nvisibility, the power lines  must either be illuminated or another means of identifying them are  used and a \nsafe path of travel is identified. No public comments  concerning this provision were received; therefore, it is \npromulgated  as proposed. Section 1926.1412 Inspections      This section seeks to prevent injuries and \nfatalities caused by  equipment failures by establishing an inspection process that  identifies and addresses \nsafety concerns. The reasoning underlying the  proposed requirements is discussed at 73 FR 59766 -59776, \nOct. 9, 2008.  The following addresses public comments and differences between the  proposed and final",

In addition, \nproposed Sec.  1926.1408(g)(1)(i)(E) stated that  training was required in the need to avoid approaching or \ntouching  \"the equipment.\" In th e proposed rule's preamble, OSHA stated that it  determined that C -DAC \ninadvertently failed to add the phrase \"and the  load\" to that provision, since whenever the equipment is in \nelectrical  contact with a power line, the load may also be energized. OSHA  requested public comment on \nwhether that provision should be modified  to correct this omission. Commenters agreed that adding the \nphrase  \"and the load\" was appropriate. (ID -0051.0; -0205.1; -0213.1.)  Therefore, OSHA has made this \naddition in the final rule.     In the proposed rule, the Agency noted that proposed Sec.   1926.1408(g) did \nnot address the timing and frequency of this training.  OSHA requested public comment on whether and, if \nso, how the standard  should address training timing and frequency.     The one commenter on this issue \nadvocated not dictating the timing  or frequency of training in this provision. For the final rule, OSH A  has \ndecided to cross reference the testing administration requirements  of Sec.  1926.1430. That training section \nrequires that employees be  evaluated to confirm that they understand the information provided in  the \ntraining, and that refresher trainin g be provided when, based on  employee conduct, there is an indication \nthat retraining is necessary.  Section 1926.1408(g) is modified accordingly. Paragraph (h)     In the proposed \nrule, this provision required that where devices  originally designed by t he manufacturer for use as safety \ndevices,  operational aids, or a means to prevent power line contact or  electrocution are used to comply \nwith Sec.  1926.1408, they must meet  the manufacturer's procedures for use and conditions of use. The  \nCommittee concluded that this provision is necessary to ensure that the  devices work as intended. No \ncomments were received on this provision,  and it is promulgated without change. (See Sec.  1926.1417 for \na discussion  of OSHA's authority to require compliance with  manufacturer procedures.) Section 1926.1409 \nPower Line Safety (Over 350 kV)     As proposed, the requirements in Sec. Sec.  1926.1407 and 1926.1408  \nwould apply to power lines rated over 350 kV in all respects except  one: Wherever the regulatory text states \n\"20 feet,\" \"50 feet\" would  be substituted. Therefore, the \"trigger\" distance that would be used  when \nassessing an assembly/disassembly area or work zone would be 50  feet. In addition, an employer engaged in \nassembly/disassembly that is  using Option (2) of proposed Sec.  1926.1407(a)(2), or an employer  engaged \nin crane operations that is using Option (2) of proposed Sec.   1926.1408(a)(2)(ii), would be required to \nmaintain a minimum clearance  distance of 50 feet. This would apply to all power lines rated over 350  kV, \nincluding power lines over 1,000 kV.     For power lines over 1,000 kilovolts,\\54\\ employers electing to use  \nTable A of Sec.  1926.1408 in either assembly/disassembly (Option (3)  in Sec.  1926.1407(a)(3)) or crane \noperations (Option (3) in Sec.   1926.1408(a)(2)(iii)) are required, pursuant to instructions in the  Table, to \nmaintain a minimum clearance distan ce determined by the  utility owner/operator or a registered \nprofessional engineer who is a  qualified person with respect to electrical power transmission and  \ndistribution. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\54\\ OSHA does not believe that \nthere are any electric power  transmission lines in the United States that operate at more than  800 kV. \nHowever, there may be some power lines associated with  research laboratories or other similar facilities that \noperate at  more than 1,000 kV.",

OSHA does not agree with this commenter. As discussed above, under  paragraph (b) of \nthis section, equipment otherwise covered by the  standard remains covered when used with attachments \nthat are either  \"crane-attached or suspended.\" The description of the robotic arm  supplied by the \ncommenter suggests that the robotic arm fits within  paragraph (b). As explained above, paragraph (b) is \ndesigned to avoid  having equipment move in and out of coverage as attachments are added  and removed. \nExcluding a crane when a robotic arm is attached would be  inconsistent with that objective. Moreover, as the \npreamble to the  proposed rule stated, even when a crane is being used for a non - hoisting purpose, its \nhoisting capability is still present, and most of  its operational characteristics and hazards remain the same \nwhile the  attachment is in use.      For those reasons, and those explained in the preamble to the  \nproposed rule, paragraph (c)(1) is promulgated as proposed (see 73 FR  59729, Oct. 9, 2008).     Proposed \nparagraph (c)(2) excluded power shovels, excavators, wheel  loaders, backhoes, loader backhoes, and track \nloaders. It provided that  such machinery is also excluded when used with chains, slings or other  rigging to \nlift suspended loads. These types of material handling  machinery were excluded even though, when used to \nlift suspended loads,  they present hazards similar to those associated with equipment covered  by the \nproposed rule. However, C -DAC proposed to exclude them because  it determi ned that the differences \nbetween the equipment included in  the standard and the material handling machinery that is excluded are  \nsuch that one standard could not be readily designed to suit both. OSHA  agrees. It should be noted that \nanother construction standard, Sec.   1926.602 in subpart O --Motor Vehicles, Mechanized Equipment, and \nMarine  Operations, covers the material handling equipment that is excluded  from this standard. No \ncomments were received concerning paragraph  (c)(2), and it is promulgate d as proposed.      Proposed \nparagraph (c)(3) excluded automotive wreckers and tow  trucks \"when used to clear wrecks and haul vehicles\" \n(see explanation  at 73 FR 59729, Oct. 9, 2008). No comments were submitted on this  paragraph, and it is \npromulgated as proposed for the reasons provided  in the preamble to the proposed rule.      Proposed \nparagraph (c)(4) would have excluded service trucks with  mobile lifting devices that are designed specifically \nfor use in the  power line and electric industries when t hose trucks are used either to  auger holes to set \npower and utility poles or to handle associated  materials that will be installed or removed from utility poles. \nA  digger derrick, or radial boom derrick, is an example of such a truck.      This machinery is currently \ncovered by subpart N, with the  exception of certain provisions, by virtue of Sec.  1926.952(c). We  note \nthat ASME B30.5-2004 excludes digger derricks and \"cranes  manufactured specifically for, or when used for, \nenergized electrical  line service\" from the scope of that industry consensus standard.      Digger derricks \nare a specialized type of equipment designed to  install utility poles. They are equipped with auge rs to drill \nholes for  the poles and with a hydraulic boom to lift the poles and set them in  the holes. The booms can \nalso be used to lift objects other than poles,  and electric utilities use them both to place objects on utility \npoles  and for general lifting purposes at worksites such as utility  substations. (ID-0139.1.) Digger derricks \nhave rated capacities as high  as 36,000 pounds. (ID-0369.1.) When electric utilities are finished  with them, \nthey sell them to other construction companies.

The Agency interprets ISO 11660-2:1994(E) \nas  addressing steps, handholds, ladders and guardrails/railings/ grabrails independent of ISO 11660-1:2008(E). \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------      Paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section requires \nwalking/stepping  surfaces on tower cranes to have slip -resistant features/properties,  such as diamond \nplate metal, strategically placed grip tape, expanded  metal, or slip -resistant paint. Similar to paragraph \n(c)(3)(ii) (see  above discussion of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)), paragraph (c)(4)(ii) carries  forward the anti -skid \nprotections from for mer Sec.   1926.550(a)(13)(iii). Paragraph (d) Personal Fall Arrest and Fall Restraint \nSystems     Paragraph (d) of this section addresses personal fall arrest  systems and fall restraint systems \nused to satisfy the requirements  under subpart CC to provide fall protection.     Paragraph (d) was not in \nthe proposed rule but has been added to  the final rule to make clear that certain appropriate requirements \nof  subpart M apply to subpart CC. Paragraph (d) requires the use of  personal fall arrest system components \nin personal fall arrest and fall  restraint systems required by subpart CC. These systems must conform to  all \nof the criteria in Sec.  1926.502 of subpart M, except Sec.   1926.502(d)(15). Section 1926.502(d)(15) \nprovides general criteria for  anchorages for personal fall arrest systems, but OSHA is choosing to  apply the \nanchorage criteria in Sec.  1926.1423(g)(3) rather than the  criteria in Sec.  1925.502(d)(15). This approach \nis consistent with the  approach to requirements for personal fall arrest and fall restraint  systems provided \nin Sec.  1926.760(d)(2) of subpart R, except for the  exclusion of Sec.  1926.502(d)(15).  Paragraph (e) Fall \nProtection Requirements for Non-Assembly/Disassembly  Work     Paragraph (e) of this section addresses \nfall protection  requirements for employees engaged in work other than assembly/ disassembly work (\"non-\nA/D\" work). For such work, in certain  circumstances, employers are required to provide and ensure the use \nof  fall protection equipment for employees who are on a walking/working  surface with an unprotected side \nor edge more than 6 feet above a lower  level.     C-DAC discussed different trigger heights for fall \nprotection  requirements for particular types of cranes and derricks. Ultimately,  C-DAC concluded that the \nrequirements for fall protection should remain  consistent with 29 CFR part 1926 subpart M, which generally \nrequires  fall protection at heights at and above 6 feet, as much as possible.  (As discussed below, for \nassembly/disassembly (A/D) work, the Committee  recommended fall protection beginning at 15 feet.) C-DAC \nalso  determined that operators do not need to be tied off while moving to  and from their cabs, a nd \nparagraph (e)(1) of this section, discussed  below, therefore requires fall protection equipment only when \nemployees  are moving point-to-point on booms or while at a work station (with  certain exceptions).

A railroad company stated that  certification tests used by the two accredited testing organizations  \nrequire knowledge of skills that do not apply in the railroad industry.  (ID-0176.1.) A railroad association stated \nthat railroads use cranes in  fundamentally different ways than construction companies and that  neither \n[currently] accredited testing organization has tests that  address the use of cranes on railroads. (ID-0170.1.) \nA representative  from another railroad company testified that some of the types of  cranes his railroad uses \nare fundamentally different from the typical  cranes used in the construction industry. Among the cranes that \nhe said  are unique to the railroad industry are locomotive cranes and rubber- tired cranes that can either run \non the ground or travel on rails. (ID - 0342.) The representative stated that certi fication tests on typical  \nconstruction cranes were not suited to the types of cranes used in his  industry and asked that the rule offer \nthe latitude for the industry to  train operators in a way that makes sense for railroads. (ID -0342.)     The \ncomments and testimony by the railroad industry representatives  suggest the need for some flexibility in the \ncertification requirement  to deal with specialized types of cranes or newly developed equipment  for which \ncertification examinations might not be available. Another  aspect of this problem was raised by an energy \nassociation, which said  that the cranes used in erecting wind turbi nes are the largest and most  complex \navailable, and that certification for such equipment is not  currently available. (ID -0329.1.)     C-DAC \naddressed one example of a type of equipment--dedicated pile  drivers--for which certification examinations \nwere not available.  Section 1926.1439(e) of the proposed rule accommodated this problem by  providing \nthat dedicated pile driver operators can be certified either  for operation of dedicated pile drivers or for \nequipment that is most  similar to dedicated pile drivers. OSHA concludes a similar approach is  appropriate \nfor any equipment for which a certification is not  available. Accordingly, OSHA is adding Sec.  1926.1427(b)(2) \nto the  final rule, which allows an operator to be certified to operate a crane  if he or she is certified to \noperate a higher -capacity version of that  type of crane or, if no accredited certification entities offer  \ncertification for that particular crane, if he or she is certified to  operate the type of crane most similar to the \nequipment in question.     In light of this change, OSHA is deleting Sec.  1926.1439(e) from  the final rule \nas it is no longer necessary. Paragraph (b)(2) will also  facilitate employers' compliance with the requirements \nof Sec.   1926.1427 by making it clear that the operator's certificate must  indicate the particular type and \ncapacity of crane for which the  operator was certified.     As discussed in the proposed rule, during the \nSBREFA process,  several small entity representatives suggested that basing  certification on the type of \ncrane might result in some capable  operators being denied certification. They described situations in  which \nan operator is knowledgeable and skillful with respect to one  particular model of crane but might be unable \nto obtain certification  based on equipment capacity and type. In response to this concern, OSHA  sought \npublic comment on whether there should be a mechanism for an  operator to become certified on a particular \nmodel of crane.     Some commenters supported such a mechanism. (ID-0145.1; -0151.1; - 0194.1; -0214.1.) \nSeveral commenters who opposed the suggestion stated  that such certification would likely not be available \nfrom testing  organizations, that employers who use Option (2) would find it costly  and impractical to \ndevelop tests for each model of crane, and that  testing based on crane model was not appropriate because \nthe skill set  and knowledge required for safe operation are not model -dependent. (ID- 0175.2; -0205.1; -\n0213.1.) Witnesses at the hearing also opposed model- specific certification. (ID-0341; -0343.)     OSHA has \nconcluded that expansion of the options to include  certification on a specific model of crane is not necessary.",

This  is an essential first step in preventing the operator from moving the  superstructure \nand causing injury to that employee. This provision is  adopted without change from the prop osal.     \nParagraph (a)(3)(ii)(A) of this section of the proposed rule stated  that the operator was prohibited from \nrotating the superstructure  unless and until he/she gave a warning that the employee in the hazard  area \nunderstood as a signal that the s uperstructure was about to be  rotated. This was intended to give the \nemployee time to get to a safe  area. Alternatively, under proposed paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(B), the  operator \ncould rotate the superstructure if he/she was informed, in  accordance with a p rearranged system of \ncommunication, that the  employee who was in the hazard area had moved to a safe position.      Several \ncommenters suggested that the compliance option in proposed  paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A) was insufficient to \nguarantee the safety of the  employee in the hazard area. (See, e.g., ID-0122.0.) A similar issue  was discussed \nin connection with Sec.  1926.1404(e) of the final rule.  Section 1926.1404(e) addresses employees in the \nswing radius area or  crush/caught-in-between zone during the as sembly/disassembly process.  (See \ndiscussion of Sec.  1926.1404(e) for additional information.)      For the reasons discussed with regard to \nthe issue raised under  Sec.  1926.1404(e), OSHA has removed proposed paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A)  from this \nsection, revised proposed paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(B), and  renumbered it paragraph (a)(3)(ii).      Paragraph \n(a)(3)(ii) requires the operator to get information that  the employee has cleared the hazard area before \nrotating the  superstructure. The method of communication must be one that is pre - arranged. Examples of \nsuch a system are provided in the discussion of  Sec.  1926.1404(e) above.      For a full discussion of C -\nDAC's rationale for the provisions in  paragraph (a), see the preamble to the proposed rule (73 FR 59803 - \n59804, Oct. 9, 2008).     Proposed paragraph (b) of this section addressed situations where  multiple pieces \nof equipment are located in such proximity that their  working radii overlap. Such situations pose the danger \nof employees  being pinched/crushed between the equipment and being injured as a  result of unintended \nmovement or collapse when pieces of equipment  collide. To prevent such accidents, the proposal required \nthe  controlling entity to coordinate the operations of these pieces of  equipment. In the event that there \nwas no controlling entity, the  proposal required the employers operating the equipment to institute a  \ncoordination system.     A commenter asked that Sec.  1926.1424(b) be deleted, or  alternatively, that an \nexemption be created for employers in the home  building industry. (ID-0232.1.) However, this commenter did \nnot provide  evidence that equipment coordination is any less necessary o n a  residential job site than it is \non other construction job sites.  Another representative of the building industry also objected to  imposing \nobligations on a \"controlling entity,\" but did not dispute  the necessity of equipment coordination on \nconstruction job sites. (ID- 0214.1.) C-DAC concluded that the controlling entity, to the extent  there is one, is \nin the best position to take responsibility for the  coordination required by paragraph (b). OSHA has not been \npersuaded  otherwise.     Both commenters nominated members which served on the negotiated  \nrulemaking committee. Neither of their respective nominees dissented on  these provisions during the \nnegotiated rulemaking meetings and neither  organization has explained why its position is different from that \nof  its nominated member . In light of this inconsistency, OSHA has given  diminished weight to these \ncomments.     The C-DAC language for proposed paragraph (b) did not address a  situation in which only \none employer is responsible for the operation  of multiple pieces of equipment. OSHA requested comment \nabout revising  the C-DAC language to make clear that such an employer would be  required to institute a \ncoordination system. No comments were received  on this issue.",

(ID-0165.1; -0184.1; -0218.1; -0231.1; -0233.1; -0235.1.)     \nOSHA notes some commenter confusion regarding instances when the  construction materials are not \ndelivered to the curb or a stockyard but  instead to a designated area on the construction site where the  \nmaterials are staged/organized to facilitate hoisting activities. In  these scenarios, OSHA construction \nstandards apply. See, e.g., Letter to  Johnson (2/6/08) (stacking of materials), Letter to Reynolds (1/5/01) \n(delivery  of materials onto structure). When hoisting equipment is used to arrange the  materials in a \nparticular sequence for hoisting or to lift materials onto a  structure that is under construction, it is being used \nto expedite work  that is integral to the construction process and is, therefore,  construction work.

Paragraph (a) Boom Free Fall Prohibitions     Under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the use \nof equipment in  which the boom is designed to free fall is prohibited under six  specified conditions.     \nParagraph (a)(1)(i) prohibits the use of a live boom when an  employee is in the fall zone of the boom or load \n(see the explanation  of \"fall zone\" in the discussion above of Sec.  1926.1425(b)).  Section 1926.1425, \nKeeping clear of the load, of this s tandard  recognizes that there are some situations in which certain \nemployees  need to be positioned in the fall zone to perform their assigned  duties. However, when \nequipment with a live boom is in use, the  likelihood that an employee would sustain a se rious injury or be \nkilled  by a free fall is very high when an employee is in the fall zone of the  boom or load.     Paragraph \n(a)(1)(ii) prohibits use of a live boom when an employee  is being hoisted by equipment. If a hoisted employee \nwas dropped in an  uncontrolled fall, the likelihood of a serious injury would be high.     No comments were \nreceived for paragraphs (a)(1)(i) or (ii); they  are promulgated as proposed.     Paragraph (a)(1)(iii) as set \nforth in the proposed rule, would have  prohibited the use of a live boom where the load or boom is directly  \nover a power line, or over any part of the area extending the Table A  of proposed Sec.  1926.1408 clearance \ndistance to each side of the  power line. The diagram below illustrates a situation in which a load  on a live \nboom is over the area extending the Table A clearance  distance to each side of the power line:  Illustration \nof a load on a live boom is over the area extending the Table A clearance distance to each side of the power \nline      As discussed above in relation to Sec. Sec.  1926.1407 through  1926.1411, equipment making \nelectrical contact with power lines is one  of the primary causes of equipment-related deaths on construction \nsites  and, to prevent such contact, those sections would require equipment to  maintain minimum distances \nfrom power lines.     In the proposed rule, OSHA determines that there are circumstances  where neither \nthe boom nor the load are directly over the power li ne or  Table A clearance distance, but where the power \nline or the Table A  clearance distance is within the fall path of the boom or load. This  circumstance is \ndepicted in the following illustrations:   Illustration A and Illustration B       In Illustration A, neither the \nboom nor the load is above the power  line or any part of the Table A zone. However, if the boom were to  \nfall, the boom would cross into the Table A zone. In Illustration B,  neither the boom nor load is above the \npower line or any part of the  Table A zone. However, if the boom were to fall, the load would cross  into the \nTable A zone.     OSHA requested comment in the proposed rule as to whether Sec.   1926.1426(a)(1)(iii) \nshould be modified to also prohibit the equipment  from being positioned such that the fall path of the boom \nor load would  breach the Table A of Sec.  1926.1408 clearance distance. This  requirement was proposed \nto prevent the boom, hoist line, or load from  contacting an energized power line and carrying the electric  \ncurrent  back through the equipment. One commenter, in two comments, agreed with  the proposed change. \n(ID-0052.0; -0092.1.) No commenters disagreed.     Therefore, OSHA has modified Sec.  1926.1426(a)(1)(iii) \nto prohibit  free fall (live boom) where the power line or the Table A clearance  distance is within the fall path \nof the boom or the load.     Paragraph (a)(1)(iv) prohibits use of a live boom where the load is  over a shaft. \nEmployees in a shaft receiving a load are at high risk of  death or injury from a free falling boom as the shaft \nseverely limits  the ability to avoid the falling boom. Because this hazard only exists  when there is an \nemployee in the shaft, OSHA has specified in Sec.",

When the \noperator is not able to see an elevated warning  line or barricade when working closer than t he Table A \nclearance  distance, it is necessary to provide an additional layer of protection  by requiring the use of video \nequipment to enable the operator to see  the warning line or barricade. Therefore, in all cases when working  \ncloser than the Table A clearance distance, the operator will have  \"two sets of eyes\" (in addition to other \nprotection required under  this section) to ensure that the equipment maintains the minimum  clearance \ndistance established under Sec.  1926.1410(c). This paragraph  is adopted as proposed.  Paragraph (d)(4) \nInsulating Link/Device     Under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, an insulating link/device  must be installed \nat a point between the end of the load line (or  below) and the load. As described in the discussion of Sec.  \n1926.1408,  an insulating link is a barrier to the passage of electrical current.  When used on a crane, it \nprevents the load from becoming energized if  the boom or the load line makes electrical contact with a power \nline  and prevents the equipment from becoming energized if the load contacts  a power line.      As \nexplained in the discussion of Sec.  1926.1408(b)(4)(v), OSHA  anticipates that NRTL approval of these \ndevices, which is necessary  from them to meet the definition of \"insulating link\" under Sec.   1926.1401, \nwill not be available for up to one year after the effective  date of this rule. OSHA is providing two phase -in \nperiods to allow time  for the NRTL recognition process, and to phase in the requirement in a  manner that \nwill reduce the economic burden on employers with existing  inventories of devices that would qualify as \n\"insulating links/ devices,\" as defined in Sec.  1926.1401, except that they have not  been subject to NRTL \napproval (\"non-approved links\"). First, OSHA is  providing for an alternative measure that will be available to \nall  employers for one year after the effective date of the standard. Sec.   1926.1410(d)(4)(iv). Second, OSHA \nis allowing employers who have  existing inventory of non-approved links to continue to use these links  for \nan additional two years (up to a total of three years after the  effective date of the final rule), so long as the \nsame protections  required for the alternative me asures available during the one -year  interim period \nremain in place. Sec.  1926.1410(d)(4)(v). However, the  use of links manufactured after the one-year interim \nperiod is  prohibited unless they are NRTL-approved as required by the definition  of \"insulating link/device\" \nin Sec.  1926.1401.      The absence of an insulating link can result in the load becoming  energized if the \nequipment makes electrical contact with a power line  or the equipment becoming energized if the load makes \nelectrical  contact with a power line. When working inside the clearances permitted  under Table A, the \ndanger of such electrical contact is increased. As  an interim precaution until insulating links (as defined in Sec.   \n1926.1401) become available, OSHA is requiring that all employees who  may come in contact with the \nequipment, the load line, or the load,  excluding equipment operators located on the equipment, must be  \ninsulated or guarded from the equipment, the load line, and the load.  Insulating gloves rated for the voltage \ninvolved are adequate  insulation for the purposes of this alternative. This interim  precaution will provide \nsome degree of protection to employees working  near the eq uipment or load by providing a layer of \ninsulation should  the equipment or the load become energized. During the one -year interim  period \nfollowing the effective date of subpart CC, OSHA is encouraging,  but not requiring, the use of non-approved \nlinks as an extra form of  protection (although they cannot be used to satisfy the standard).     OSHA is also \nproviding a separate alternative measure that would  apply for an additional two -year transition period \n(following the  first-year interim period, for a total of three years) to address  employers who already own or \npurchase non -approved links.",

The purpose  of this provision is to ensure that the equipment can operate safely  under the \nforces imposed on it. In its deliberations, the Committee  noted that the manufacturer is in the best position \nto determine the  maximum external l oads the vessel/flotation device can withstand while  maintaining \nnecessary stability and buoyancy, and that requiring  employers to adhere to the manufacturer's specifications \nand  limitations would provide employees with the requisite level of  protection.     The language of the \nproposed rule varied from the text in the C-DAC  consensus document. OSHA made this revision to clarify that \nit was an  employer's responsibility to follow the manufacturer's specifications  and limitations. OSHA \nrequested public comment on this revision. OSHA  received two comments in response to this request. (ID -\n0205.1; - 0213.1.) Both commenters stated the C-DAC language showed the  Committee's \"original intent of \nthis paragraph was a design  specification,\" and further stated that the revision as proposed by  OSHA did \nnot consider the Committee's language was addressing design  specifications.     On reviewing these \ncomments, the C-DAC consensus document, and  OSHA's proposed text, OSHA determines that paragraph (k) \nneeds to  address both the commenters' position that there is a need for a design  specification, and OSHA's \nposition in the proposed rule that employers  must comply to the manufacturer's specifications and \nlimitations. OSHA  revised proposed paragraph (k) accordingly.     In addition, another commenter raised \nthe issue that, for many  vessels covered by this section, the manufacturer no longer exists, or  that the vessel \nhas been modified and an expert has established the  appropriate specifications and limitations for the vessel. \n(ID- 0345.26.) One commenter noted the company's fleet had vessels that were  60 years old and the \nmanufacturers of some of these vessels were no  longer in business. (ID-0344.1.) OSHA finds these comments \npersuasive,  and is adding a provision to paragraph (k) to require the employer to  follow specifications and \nlimitations established by a qualified person  in such instances.  Paragraph (l) [Reserved.]  Paragraph (m) \nFloating Cranes/Derricks     Paragraph (m) of this section sets forth requirements with respect  to load \ncharts, rated capacity, allowable list, allowable trim, wind  speed and related measures for floating \ncranes/derricks. The  requirements in Sec. Sec.  1926.1437(m)(1) through (5) address the  various hazards \nthat contribute to instability of the vessel/flotation  device and the effect of marine conditions that can lead \nto boom/  equipment failure.      As defined in Se c.  1926.1401, a floating crane/derrick includes  \nequipment built either by a manufacturer or by the employer using the  equipment. Both types must meet \nthe criteria in Sec. Sec.   1926.1437(m)(1) through (m)(3). These provisions are designed to  prevent the \ncrane/derrick portion of the equipment from failure due to  overloading, thereby, preventing the \nvessel/flotation device from  capsizing.     Paragraph (m)(1) requires that load charts applicable to \noperations  on water not be exceeded. Paragraph (m)(2)  establishes criteria (in  Table M1) for maximum \nallowable list and trim relative to the rated  capacity of the equipment. Section 1926.1437(m)(3) provides two \ncharts  that set the stability criteria for specific conditions. The first of  these charts (Table M2) contains the \nminimum requirements to maintain  stability with respect to wind speed and freeboard distance of the  \nvessel/flotation device. The second chart (Table M3) addresses the  backward stability of the boom.     The \nAgency requested public comment on a definition of freeboard as  it is used in Table M2. In response, a \ncommenter offered this  definition: \"Freeboard is the vertical distance between the water line  and the main \ndeck of the vessel.\" (ID-0383.1.)",

Sec.  1926.1413(c)(2)(ii)(C) and (c)(2)(ii)(F) because  Sec.  \n1926.1413(c)(2)(ii)(A) incorporates by reference the critical  review items listed in Sec. Sec.  \n1926.1413(a)(3)(iv) and (a)(3)(v),  thereby making the items listed in Se c. Sec.  1926.1413(c)(2)(ii)(C)  and \n(c)(2)(ii)(F) redundant. OSHA did not receive any adverse comment  on modifying Sec. Sec.  \n1926.1413(a)(3)(iv) and (a)(3)(v) in this  manner and modified Sec.  1926.1413(a)(3) accordingly.  Paragraph \n(a)(4) Removal From Service     Paragraph (a)(4) of this section of the proposed rule set out  remedial steps \nto be taken once the competent person performing the  inspection identifies an apparent deficiency. Those \nsteps depended upon  whether, under Sec.  1926.1413(a)(2), t he deficiency falls under  Category I, II, or III. \nUnder this approach, immediate removal from  service would be required for certain deficiencies, while \ncontinued use  under prescribed circumstances would be allowed for others before the  rope must be \nremoved from service. When removal from service is  required, the provisions of Sec.  1926.1417 (Operation) \napply, and the  inspector must either tag out the entire equipment or the hoist with  the damaged wire rope. \nThis approach was adopted by C -DAC because, in  the Committee's collective experience, different types of \ndeficiencies  warrant different responses, with some deficiencies being so serious  that continued use of the \nrope must be prohibited while other  deficiencies may, if adequately evaluated and monitored, allow  \ncontinued use of the rope for a limited time.     Paragraph (a)(4)(i) applies to Category I apparent deficiencies.  \nParagraph (a)(4)(i)(B) allows the rope to be severed under some  circumstances and the undamaged part to \nbe used. Two commenters  suggested that language be added to require the user to verify that the  drum \nwill still have at least two wraps of rope around it when the  block is lowered to its lowest position. (ID-0122; \n-0178.1.) The  concern of these commenters is that shortening the rope too much might  not leave enough \nrope to allow a sufficient margin of safety (two  wraps) to remain on the drum and prevent the rope  from \nbecoming  disconnected from the drum.      Another provision of the final rule, Sec.  1926.1417(t), \naddresses  this potential safety hazard by requiring that neither the load nor the  boom be lowered below \nthe point where less than two full wraps of rope  remain on their respective drums. Normally, newly installed \nropes are  long enough to ensure compliance with Sec.  1926.1417(t) when the load  or boom are in their \nlowest positions, and these commenters are  concerned that shortening the rope could re sult in the rope \nbecoming  disconnected if the remaining part of the rope is not long enough to  always ensure that two \nwraps remain on the drum.      OSHA agrees with this comment and is adding language to paragraph  \n(a)(4)(i)(B) (and also to paragraphs (a)(4)(iii)(B) and (c)(3)(i)(B) of  this section, which contain a similar provision) \nto specify that if a  wire rope is shortened under this paragraph, the employer is required  to ensure that the \ndrum will still have two wraps of wire rope when the  load and/or boom is in its lowest position.     OSHA \nalso notes that paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B) twice refers to power  line contact in the phrases \"other than power line \ncontact\" and  \"repair of wire rope that contacted an energized power line is also  prohibited.\"",

(ID-0187.1.) That commenter  recommended that the requirement be upgraded to a lock -out \nrequirement  where feasible, but remain a tag out procedure where lock out was not  feasible. Upon \nconsideration of all these comments, OSHA concludes that  the record does not clearly indicate that adding a \nlock-out requirement  as suggested by the last two commenters is needed to ensure safety and,  as the one \ncommenter noted, would not be feasible on all equipment.  Instead, the Agency concludes that the tag -out \nrequirement in the  proposed rule contains clear and concise restrictions on the conditions  under which \nequipment can be brought back into service and will ensure  that equipment is not started when employees \nare in a danger zone.  Therefore, this section is promulgated as proposed. Paragraph (g)     This paragraph \nrequires the operator to verify, before starting the  engine, that all controls are in the proper starting position \nand that  all personnel are in the clear. Requiring operators to check that all  controls are in their proper \nstarting positions will prevent unintended  movement of the equipment when the engine is initially started.  \nSimilarly, requiring operators to ensure that all personnel are in the  clear will prevent personnel from being \ninjured in the event that some  aspect of the equipment moves upon start-up. No comments were submitted  \non this paragraph; therefore it is promulgated as proposed.  Paragraph (h) Storm Warning     When a local \nstorm warning has been issued, this paragraph requires  the competent person to determine whether it is \nnecessary to implement  manufacturer recommendations for securing the equipment. This provision  was \ndesigned to prevent hazards that could arise from severe weather  including inadvertent movement and crane \ncollapse. High-speed winds in  particular can affect both the crane and the load, reducing the rated  capacity \nof the crane and affecting boom strength. No comments were  submitted on this paragraph; therefore it is \npromulgated as proposed. Paragraph (i) [Reserved.] Paragraph (j)     Under paragraph (j)(1) of this section, \nwhen the operator  determines that an adjustment/repair is necessary, the operator is required  to promptly \ninform, in writing, the individual designated by the employer  to receive such information, as well as the next \noperator in cases where there  are successive shifts. OSHA revised the organization of the proposed provision  \nfor clarity. This reorganization involved removing the introductory sentence that  operators be familiar with \nthe equipment and its proper operation  because this sentence merely described an enabling condition \nnecessary  for operators to identify any necessary repairs and adjustments.      This paragraph addresses \nthe need to identify problems that may  develop with the equipment during operations. Early recognition of \nsuch  problems by the operator will help prevent accidents that could result  from continued operation of \nequipment that needs adjustment and/or  repair. In the Committee's experience, operators who are familiar \nwith  the equipment and its proper operation can recognize such equipment  anomalies and problems. By \nrequiring that information about needed  adjustments and/or repairs be provided to the individual designated \nby  the employer to receive it, this paragraph will facilitate the  correction of those problems.     The rule \ndoes not specify any particular job title for the person  to whom the operator would be required to provide \nthis information  because different employers may assign the responsibility of receiving  such information to \ndifferent job classifications.     Providing this information to the next operator in cases where  there are \nsuccessive shifts (that is, shifts that have no break between  them) will ensure that the next operator is aware \nof this information  and will be able to take appropriate action.     One commenter recommended that the \ninformation be transmitted in  written form. (ID-0132.1.) OSHA agrees with this comment primarily  because \nwritten information would b e more easily passed on between  shifts. OSHA has, therefore, revised Sec.  \n1926.1417(j) to specify that  the notification of necessary adjustments or repairs must be in  writing.",

This type of device \ndetects and prevents a potential overload condition  which could cause the load to fall, the crane to collapse \nor other  failure of the crane.      Where the load moment limiting device is not in proper working  \ncondition, two types of measures are required. The first type of  measure is designed to ensure that the \noperator determines the radius.  If the crane is equipped with a radius indicating device, it is  required to be \nused. If the crane is not so equipped, the radius is  required to be measured (such as with a tape measure) to \nensure that  the load is within the rated capacity of the crane.     The second type of measure is designed \nto ensure that the operator  accurately determines the weight of the load. The load weight is  required to be \ndetermined from a source recognized by the industry  (such as the load's ma nufacturer), or by a calculation \nmethod  recognized by the industry (such as calculating a steel beam from  measured dimensions and a \nknown per foot weight). This information must  be provided to the operator prior to the lift. The proposed \nrule had  provided for calculations based on a \"reliable\" source or calculation  method, or \"by other equally \nreliable means.\" To avoid potentially  subjective interpretations of \"reliable,\" OSHA is instead requiring  that \nthe measurements be from a source typically reli ed on in the  industry.     Paragraph (e)(5)(vi) requires a \nhoist line pull limiting device so  that the load applied to the hoist drum will not exceed the hoist's  capacity. \nIf the hoist is equipped with a multiple speed hoist  transmission, the device would have to limit the hoist's \nlifting  capacity in each individual gear ratio. If the hoist line pull were to  exceed the hoist's capacity, the \nhoist could fail and unspool the line,  causing the load to drop suddenly.      The temporary alternative \nmeasure for this operational aid is that  the operator ensure that the weight of the load does not exceed the  \ncapacity of the hoist, taking into account each individual ge ar ratio  if the crane is equipped with a multiple \nspeed hoist transmission. For  example, this could be done by the operator checking the hoist capacity  in \nthe equipment manual and verifying that the load will not exceed  that capacity.     Paragraph (e)(5)(vii) \nrequires a rail travel limiting device in  each direction to prevent the travel bogies from running into the end  \nstops or buffers. As noted above, rail stops that keep the crane from  overshooting the section of rail within \nwhich it is supposed to operate  is one of the safety devices required for tower cranes that travel on  rails. A \nrail travel limiting device is a device that limits the  crane's travel to keep a travel bogie from running into a \nrail stop. C- DAC determined that rail stops should not be the exclusive means of  ensuring that the crane stays \nwithin its intended limits because the  travel bogie could jump the tracks if it were to strike the rail stops  at \na high enough speed. The temporary alternative to a rail travel  limiting device that is not in proper working \norder is to use a spotter  who is in direct communication with the operator when operations are  conducted \nwithin 10 feet of either end of the travel rail end stops;  the spotter must inform the operator of the distance \nof the travel  bogies from the end stops or buffers.      Proposed paragraph (e)(5)(viii) required the boom \nhoist drum to be  equipped with a device that would positively lock the boom hoist drum.  One example of \nsuch a device is a ratchet and pawl mechanism. The  purpose of the device is to prevent the boom hoist (and \ntherefore the  load as well) from inadvertently lowering. The temporary alternative  measure that was \nproposed was to require the device to  be set manually  if an electric, hydraulic, or automatic device is not \nworking.     In the proposed rule, OSHA noted that the temporary alternative  proposed in paragraph \n(e)(5)(viii) addressed the situation where the mechanism  to automatically set the l ocking device was \nmalfunctioning but did not address  the situation where the locking device itself was not working properly.",

The Agency also  concludes that the final \nstandard is economically feasible, as the  highest impacts are on employers who own and rent cranes and \neven that  impact is no more than 4 percent. Cost and impacts of that magnitude  are far less than the typical \nyearly swings in revenues and profits for  the construction industry. Economic impacts on small business are  \npresented below in the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.      Based on comment in the record, some \nemployees may bear the cost of  crane operator certification (that is, pay for their o wn  certification). The \nAgency attributes all costs of crane operator  certification to employers in the analysis, though. There may",

First, OSHA is replacing the proposed phrase \"available to the  \ncontrolling entity\" with \"in the possession of the controlling  entity, whether at the site or off -site.\" As \nexplained in the preamble  to the proposed rule,   [i]n developing this proposed provision, the Committee \nwas mindful  that the controlling entity often has access to documents that may  identify the location of such \nhazards. * * * Under this proposed  provision, if the controlling entity has such a document, whether at  the \nsite or at an off-site location, it would be required to inform  the equipment user and operator of the location \nof the hazard as  identified in it. If the controlling entity does not possess such a  document, it would not be \nrequired to obtain it from another source.       The phrase \"available to\" may be interpreted as including  \ndocuments that the controlling entity does not already have in its  possession but has the ability to obtain, \ni.e., procure, from other  entities. As is evident from the proposed rule explanation quoted  above, the intent \nis to apply the duty only with respect to information  that is already in the controlling contractor's possession, \nwhether at  the site or off-site.     Second, OSHA is revising the text of paragraph (c)(2) of this  section to \nemphasize that the employer's existing responsibilities  under OSHA's multi-employer policy are not changed \nby this new rule. As  noted above and in the pre amble to the proposed rule, the duties  provided in Sec.  \n1926.1402 supplement, and do not displace, the  controlling entity's duties under the multi -employer \npolicy.\\11\\ The  multi-employer policy reflects the Secretary's reasonable  interpretation of the OSH Act and \nrequires controlling employers to exercise  reasonable care to prevent and detect violations on the site. See \nOSHA  CPL 02 -00-124, Multi -Employer Citation Policy, Dec. 10, 1999. Under this  policy, the controlling \nemployer has a duty to addres s hazards the employer  either creates or controls, regardless of whose \nemployees are threatened by  the hazard. See, e.g. Universal Const. Co., Inc. v. Occupational Safety  and \nHealth Review Comm'n, 182 F3d 726, 730 (10th Cir. 1999). Implicit  in those du ties is a duty to notify \nemployees of hazards the  controlling employer controls and has already detected, particularly  where such \nnotification would prevent a violation. As noted in the  preamble to the proposed rule, requiring employers \nto include hazard  information needed by downstream employees is a necessary and  appropriate means to \nensure that the employees are apprised of all  hazards to which they are exposed. (See 73 FR 59731, Oct. 9, \n2008; see  also American Petroleum Institute v. OSHA, 581 F.2d 493, 510 (5th Cir.  1978).) (OSHA may require \nupstream employers to warn downstream  employees of concealed hazards when the upstream employer \nknows of  those hazards under remedial purpose of the OSH Act and OSHA's broad  authority to prescribe \nwarning labels under 29 U.S.C. 655(b)(7)). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\11\\ \nThe Agency anticipates that the majority of controlling  entities will also be controlling employers for the \npurposes of the  multi-employer policy. However, even to the extent that a  controlling entity does not also \nmeet the definition of a  controlling employer, the Agency has the authority to require the  controlling entity \nto comply with the requirements of Sec.   1926.1402. (See discussion of authority at 73 FR 59731-59732, Oct.  \n9, 2008.) With respect to the controlling entity's duty to warn the  operator and other users of the equipment \nabout hidden ground  condition hazards, Sec.  1926.1402(c) constitutes OSHA's exercise of  its authority to \n\"prescribe the use of labels or other appropriate  forms of warning as are necessary to insure that employees \nare  apprised of all hazards to which they are exposed * * * and proper  conditions and precautions of safe \nuse or exposure.\" 29 U.S.C.  655(b)(7).",
    "5d7cfcbf-91ae-49a4-b63a-ccec20a36a95": "page_label: 341\nfile_name: OSHA-Final Rule-Cleaned.pdf\nfile_path: C:\\Users\\bs44876\\Desktop\\Project\\CII-Crane\\FineEmb\\dataset\\data\\OSHA-Final Rule-Cleaned.pdf\nfile_type: application/pdf\nfile_size: 3496317\ncreation_date: 2025-01-07\nlast_modified_date: 2025-01-07\n\nparts to  most of the criticisms. First, many builders and contractors now rely  on the crane company or the \ncrane operator to assess conditions for  safe crane operations, for example, when hiring a crane company to \nset  roof trusses. (ID-0341; -0343.) In addition, many builders or  contractors who hire cranes for particular \nconstruction jobs have no  expertise in ground conditions (ID-0341), which the Agency acknowledged  in the \nproposal's preamble. In response to these comments, the Agency  accounted for the new burden which \ncontrolling entities will have under  the final standard.     These costs fall primarily on the lessees of cranes \nor of cranes  with operators, not employers affected by the crane standard who own  their own cranes. The \nAgency concludes that, for estimating the costs  of the ground conditions provision, builders of large \ncommercial,  residential, and industrial buildings and contractors do not face a new  cost since they are, in \ngeneral, at the building site. However, small  builders and developers, or their supervisors or representative, \nmay  not be at one of their sites. (ID -0341.) The Agency estimates that th e  ground conditions duty will \nrequire two hours of employer time to be  present at the site to meet their obligations. However, the standard  \ndoes not require that controlling entities be physically present, and  the Agency concludes that in most cases \ntheir attendance at the site  will not be necessary because, in most situations, the ground  conditions will be \ndry and reasonably level, and the cranes will be  lifting materials such as roof trusses and pre-fabricated wall  \nsections--i.e., low-risk ground conditions. Any information that the  controlling entity has about underground \nrisks can be communicated by  telephone. The Agency concludes that small builders in three industries  will, \nat most, be affected by the ground condition provision at 10  percent of their projects involving crane \noperations. The Agency  concludes that the typical crane job --setting roof trusses--and the  fact that these \nloads are generally not close to the capacity of the  truck-mounted cranes that perform the task, means that \nconcern about  ground conditions will not arise often. The three affected industries are:  NAICS 236115 New \nSingle Family Housing Construction; NAICS 236117 New Housing  Operative Builders; and NAICS 236118 \nResidential Remodelers.     The Agency has estimated the costs of complying with the  controlling entities' \nduties in regard to ground conditions for SBA- size small entities in the three affected industries. The criterion \nfor  \"small entity\" for these industries by SBA is revenue of less than  $31 million. This is roughly comparable \nto construction of about 100  single family homes, and the Agency concludes that all small builders  are \ncertainly captured within this category. Accordingly, the Agency  calculated the costs of expending two hours \nof time by employers for 10  percent of all crane jobs within the industry sectors by small  employers. The \ncosts for the affected sectors are presented in Table B - 9. Table B -10 presents averag e annual costs per \nestablishment across  the affected sectors. Table B -11 provides the Agency's estimate of the  number of \ncranes and crane jobs. Language and Literacy     There was also comment in the record about the difficulty \nsome  current crane operators may have in achieving crane operator  certification due to a language barrier \nor weak literacy skills, and  thus the FEA also describes possible impacts on current and future  crane \noperators. Two testing organizations reported in the public  hearings that they neither offer crane operator \ntesting in languages  other than English nor had any plans to do so. (ID -0341: -0343.)  Testing in other \nlanguages would not merely require translating  existing written and practical test materials, but developing \nand  evaluating tests as if they were completely original. There was comment  in the record that some \ncurrent crane operators would not be able to  read and therefore successfully pass a test in English. (ID-0100.1; \n- 0243.1; -0387.) The Agency is not presenting any quantitative estimate  of the impact of the final standard \non individuals with language or  literacy issues. The final  standard has a new provision requiring that  \ncertification exams \"must be administered in a language understood by  the operator candidate\" which may",

Sec.  1926.1408 -1926.1409 of this final rule, as well  as supplementary \nprotective requirements that must be followed when the  subpart V clearance requirements cannot be \nobserved.     Subpart V's clearance requirements are found in Table V-1 of Sec.   1926.950. Subpart V does \nnot require a showing of infeasibility before  allowing subpart V work to comply with these shorter clearance  \ndistances, and OSHA concludes that the record does not s upport  requiring such a showing under the final \nrule either. The very nature  of work that alters, converts, or improves existing power lines must  necessarily \nbe carried out close to those lines, and it would almost  always be infeasible for the clearanc es in Sec. Sec.",

Repairs or adjustments are meant to restore equipment  to original design \nspecifications and safety factors. Otherwise, OSHA  considers the maintenance activity performed a \nmodification of the  equipment. In essence, repair or adjustment of a system or com ponent  must be \nconsistent with the engineering in the original equipment  design. OSHA believes that a functional test that is \nlimited to only  those components that are or may be affected by the repair or  adjustment, in conjunction \nwith the inspection required under Sec.   1926.1412(d). Each shift (discussed below), will sufficiently identify  \na deficient repair or adjustment. OSHA has therefore modified the  language of Sec.  1926.1412(b)(1)(iii) in \nthe final rule accordingly.     A commenter stated that Sec.  1926.1412(b) should be structured  similarly \nto Sec.  1926.1434, Modifications, in that the employer  should be required to consult with the manufacturer \nbefore employers  perform repairs or adjustments of equipment that relate to safe  operation. (ID-0292.) In \nthat case, the commenter stated, no third  party would be able to overrule a manufacturer statement that a \nrepair  cannot be made. The commenter believed that an employer should only be  able to go to paragraph \n(b)(1)(ii) if the manufacturer is unavailable.     OSHA does not agree with the suggested change. Implicit in \nthe  comment is the suggestion that there are inst ances where a repair  cannot be made without \ncompromising the integrity of the equipment.  That concern is already addressed by the standard. If the repair \ncannot meet the criteria in accordance with Sec.  1926.1412(b)(1)(i)  (or, if applicable, Sec.  \n1926.1412(b)(1)(i)), then the requirements in  subpart CC for modifications would have to be met. Therefore, \nOSHA  declines to adopt the suggested change. Paragraph (c) Post-Assembly     Paragraph (c) of this section \nrequires a post -assembly inspection  of equ ipment by a qualified person prior to its use. In sum, the  \nprovision requires the qualified person to assure that the equipment is  configured in accordance with the \nmanufacturer's equipment criteria. If  manufacturer equipment criteria are unavailable, the qualified person  \nmust determine whether a registered professional engineer (RPE) is  needed to develop criteria for the \nequipment configuration. If an RPE  is not needed, the employer must ensure that a qualified person  \ndevelops them. If an RPE is needed, the employer must ensure that an  RPE develops them. Equipment must \nnot be used until an inspection under  this paragraph demonstrates that the equipment is configured in  \naccordance with the applicable criteria. OSHA received no comments on  the proposed paragraph; therefore, \nit is published as proposed.  Paragraph (d) Each Shift      Paragraph (d) of this section requires a shift \ninspection, the  first of three regularly scheduled equipment inspections that are  required. Specifically, \nparagraph (d)(1) sets forth the frequency of  this inspection, the degree of scrutiny required and the level of  \nexpertise required of the person performing this inspection. The  paragraph lists the items that are required \nto be included in this  inspection and specifies the corrective action that is required. The  purpose of this \nprovision is to identify and address safety hazards  before they cause accidents.      A utility compan y \nrecommended that OSHA revise Sec.  1926.1412(d)  to read \"each shift the equipment is used * * * .\" to \nclarify that  the equipment does not have to be inspected when it will not be used on  a shift. (ID-0226.) This \nsuggested change is consistent with the intent  of the proposed rule, and OSHA is adding similar language to \nfinal rule  Sec.  1926.1412(d)(1) to clarify that intent.      One commenter asserted that OSHA should \nprohibit operation of the  equipment until the shift inspection is complete rather t han permitting  the \ninspection to be completed during the shift. (ID-0156.1.) A  different commenter disagreed. (ID-0143.) OSHA \ndoes not agree with this  suggestion. While some of the items that must be inspected can readily  be \ninspected before each shift, e.g., cab windows for deficiencies that  would hinder the operator's view, others",

Need for the Rule and \nMarket Failure     Occupational safety problems, such as safety p roblems associated  with cranes and \nderricks, routinely involve the following  characteristics that lead to market failures:      (1) A variety of \nsituations in which one party (employers, fellow  employees) take actions that impose risks of death and \ninjuries on  other parties (employees);     (2) The risk in question may not be well understood by any party,  \nor also subject to asymmetric information (the employer will typically  know more about the risks than \nemployees);     (3) The costs of the risks are routinely transferred to other  parties who typically lack the \ninformation necessary for a precise  estimate of the costs of the transfer, or are not permitted to price  \ntransfers appropriately (insurers are routinely forced to use premium  systems that do not capture all possible \nknowledge about risk).   These characteristics mean that markets will not adequately capture the  risk \ninvolved, and thus regulations are needed. (See Chapter 1 of the  FEA for more detail.)  3. Industry \nProfile/Affected Industries     The final standard would affect employers and employees across most  \nconstruction industry sectors as well as some in some general industry  sectors where cranes and derricks are \nused as part of the performance  of work duties. These industries include firms involved in renting  cranes \nfor use in construction projects such as: Multi -family housing;  industrial buildings an d warehouses; other \nnonresidential buildings;  highway and street construction; and water, sewer, power, and  communication \nline construction. As in the preliminary economic  analysis (PEA), the Agency has grouped affected \nestablishments, by  industry, into the following categories for analyzing the final  standard:      Crane \nRental with Operators,      Crane Rental without Operators,       Own and Rent Cranes with Operators,       \nOwn but Do Not Rent, and       Crane Lessees in the Construction Industry (ref erred to  simply as \"Crane \nLessees\" throughout).   The affected firms and establishments, including information on number  of \nemployees, revenues, and profits, are presented below in Table B -2.  In some sectors the number of cranes \nhas changed from the PEA because  the analysis has been updated with revenue data from the 2006 County  \nBusiness Patterns (CPB) and Statistics of U.S. Businesses (SUSB), and  in those sectors the number of cranes \nwas estimated from revenues.      The PEA accompanying the proposed s tandard presented an industry  \nprofile describing crane use in all sectors of the traditional  construction industries, the current NAICS 233 -\n236 (the older SICs 16,  17, and 18) and the crane rental industry sector in general industry,  NAICS 53214. \nThere were no comments objecting to the inclusion of these  sectors in the economic analysis. However, there \nwas comment from some  general industry sectors following publication of the proposal. They  noted that",

(ID-0198.1.) The commenter asserts  that the industry installs propane storage tanks ranging from \n120 to  5,000 gallons capacity using truck -mounted cranes to lift and place the  tanks onto supports.      \nFrom this limited description of the industry's use  of cranes, it  is likely that at least some of the industry's \nwork is construction  work. If the site at which the tank is installed is a building under  construction, \ninstallation of a propane tank would qualify as  construction work, just as the installation of an air conditioning \nunit  on that site would be construction work. At the other extreme,  replacing a small tank at an existing site \nwith a new tank of the same  capacity would be considered general industry work. In sum, based on  the \ninformation provided, it appears that some of the industry's work  is construction work and some is general \nindustry. OSHA therefore  cannot \"affirm\" that the propane industry is excluded from the  standard.     For \nthe foregoing reasons, OSHA is promulgating paragraph (a) as  proposed except for a grammatical correction \nto clarify that the  standard applies to only equipment used for construction activities.  Employers who use \ncovered equipment for both general industry work and  construction work would not be required to comply \nwith subpart CC when  the equipment is used for general industry work and not construction  work. \nParagraph (b)     Proposed paragraph (b) of this section provided that equipment  covered by paragraph (a) \nremains within the scope of the standard when  used with attachments that are either \"crane -attached or \nsuspended.\"  As defined in Sec.  1926.1401, an \"attachment\" is \"any device that  expands the range of tasks \nthat can be done by  the equipment. Examples  include, but are not limited to: an auger, drill, magnet, pile -\ndriver,  and boom-attached personnel platform.\" C-DAC decided to include such  attachments, even though \nthey might not use the crane's hoisting  mechanism, to avoid the confusion that would result if the equipment  \nmoved in and out of coverage of the rule as attachments are put on and  taken off. Furthermore, most of the \noperational characteristics and  hazards of the equipment remain the same while the attachment is in  use. \nNo comments were received regarding this paragraph, and it is  being promulgated as proposed. Paragraph (c)     \nProposed paragraph (c) of this section listed machinery that would  be specifically excluded from the scope of \nthe rule. As discussed  below, several of these proposed exclusions generated public comment.      \nProposed paragraph (c)(1) provided that machinery otherwise  included under Sec.  1926.1400(a) but \n\"converted or adapted for non - hoisting/lifting use\" is excluded. Power shovels, exca vators and  concrete \npumps are listed as nonexclusive examples of such  \"conversions/adaptations\" or modified machinery.     A \ncommenter suggested that OSHA consider including concrete pumping  trucks because they are configured as \ncranes and suspend loads  over a  distance. (ID -0178.1.) C -DAC considered this issue but decided not to  \ninclude them. While a concrete pumping truck does pose some of the same  hazards as a crane, its load (i.e., \nthe concrete being pumped) is  carried in a piping system affixed to its boom, rather than being  suspended. \nConsequently, it does not fit the functional definition in  paragraph (a) of this section. This commenter noted \nthat, like a crane,  a concrete pumping truck may have outriggers or be located near a power  line. However, \nthis standard is designed to address the hazards that  are specific to cranes and derricks rather than to address \nstability  and power line clearance issues for all typ es of construction equipment.     A commenter asked \nthat a type of equipment for which it holds  patent rights, the \"Linemaster Robotic Arm,\" be excluded. (ID - \n0209.1.) According to the commenter, this equipment is a hydraulically  powered, boom mounted, rotating \nand telescopic robotic arm that is used  to separate live power lines from poles.",

OSHA is promulgating this  provision as \nproposed.     Two commenters, both of which had nominated C -DAC members,  suggested moving this \nrequirement to Sec.  1926.1433 (Design,  construction and testing) due to their belief that an integral holding  \ndevice/check valve is a design feature. (ID -0205.1; -0213.1.) Neither  of these organizations' nominees \ndissented on this  issue. Both  organizations indicated in their comments that they supported the  \nrecommendations of C-DAC and were not providing any negative comments  on provisions that mirrored the \nC-DAC consensus document. Since this  provision is unchanged from the C -DAC consensus document, the \nAgency  assumes that the commenters believe that they are suggesting a non- substantive formatting change.     \nThe commenters are mistaken in that regard.

Therefore, \nparagraph (e)(5)(i) is being  reworded in the final rule to apply to equipment with stabilizers as  well as \noutriggers. Paragraph (e)(5)(ii), which requires hoist drum  rotation indicators, is promulgated as proposed. --\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\82\\ The proposed rule would have required \nthese aids on  equipment manufactured after January 1, 2008. Here, as elsewhere,  OSHA believes that \ndevices not commonly installed on equipment  should be not be required until more than one year after the  \neffective date of the final rule.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      One \ncommenter stated that deadman controls should be required on  all cranes. (ID -0156.1.) Section \n1926.1435(d)(2)(viii) requires that  tower cranes have deadman controls, but C-DAC did not determined these  \nshould be required on other types of cranes. This commenter has not  stated why it believes such controls are \nneeded for safe operation of  other types of cranes. Accordingly, OSHA defers to C -DAC's judgment  that \ndeadman controls should not be required on cranes other than tower  cranes. Section 1926.1417 Operation     \nSection 1926.1417 addresses hazards associated with general  operation of equipment covered by this \nstandard. Previously, 29 CFR  part 1926, subpart N primarily addressed safe operation by  incorporating \nnational consensus standards and manufacturer  recommendations. For example, former Sec.  \n1926.550(b)(2) required  crawler, truck, and locomotive cranes to comply with the operation  requirements \nof ANSI B30.5 -1968. The provisions in this section are  designed to update such requirements, make them \nmore comprehensive, and  state them in a way that is clear and enforceable. Paragraph (a)     Paragraph (a) \nof this section requires employers to comply with the  manufacturer procedures applicable to the operational \nfunctions of all  equipment covered by this standa rd, including the use of equipment with  attachments. \n\"Procedures\" is defined in Sec.  1926.1401 to include,  but not be limited to, \"instructions, diagrams, \nrecommendations,  warnings, specifications, protocols, and limitations.\"     Two commenters opposed this \nprovision. The first, a representative  from the building industry, stated that it was \"problematic\" to  \"literally \nrequire employers to become familiar with and obey to the  letter anything written by a manufacturer related \nto a crane, no matter  how unwise, unnecessary, or infeasible.\" (ID-0232.1.) The commenter  also explained \nthat crane manufacturers fear tort liability, which  causes them to over-warn in their manuals, and suggested \nthat employers  needed to be able to use common sense to separa te over -warning from  serious \nrecommendations. The commenter argued further that this  provision constituted a delegation of authority \ninconsistent with the  U.S. Constitution and the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and was  unsupported \nby the rulemaking record. A building industry trade  association agreed with the building industry \nrepresentative's points  and advocated amending this provision to require operation of equipment  in a \nmanner \"consistent with manufacturers' recommendations.\" (ID - 0214.1.) It also believed that the costs of \ncomplying with this  provision would be excessive.      OSHA disagrees with the suggestion that this \nprovision is  problematic because of the possibility that some equipment manufacturer  may conceivably \ndevelop procedures which are \"unwise, unnecessary, or  infeasible.\" Neither commenter provided any specific",

The term \nmarine  worksite is defined in Sec.  1926.1401 as \"a construction worksite  located in, on, or above the \nwater.\" Paragraph (b)     Paragraph (b) of this section prohibits modifications or additions  which affect the \ncapacity or safe operation of the equipment wh ere the  manufacturer, after a review of the technical safety \nmerits of the  proposed modification/addition, rejects the proposal and explains the  reasons for the \nrejection in a written response.     OSHA concludes, as did C-DAC, that it was important to expressly  state \nthe need for the manufacturer to explain why it rejected the  employer's proposed modification. Such an \nexplanation both demonstrates that the manufacturer reviewed the technical safety merits  of the request \nand gives the employer the opportunity to modify the  proposal to address the manufacturer's objections. If \nthe manufacturer  does not provide the reasons for its rejection in writing, the employer  may consider this \na refusal to review a request under paragraph (a)(2)  above.     No comments were received for this \nparagraph; it is promulgated as  proposed. Paragraph (c)     Paragraph (c) of this section states that the \nprovisions in  Sec. Sec.  1926. 1434(a) and (b) do not apply to modifications made or  approved by the U.S. \nmilitary. During C -DAC negotiations, a  representative of the U.S. Navy indicated to C -DAC that such an  \nexception is needed in the event of military exigencies. OSHA defers to  the Committee's expertise on this \nissue. No comments were received for  this paragraph; it is promulgated as proposed.  Section 1926.1435 \nTower Cranes Definition of Tower Crane      OSHA's proposed definition reflected three changes from the  \nCommittee draft. First, a characteristic of tower cranes that was  missing from the C-DAC definition was that \nthe working boom is in an  elevated position above the ground. Second, the working boom on some  tower \ncranes, even of the non -luffing type, may not be at a 90 deg ree  angle to the tower, and so the term \"fixed \nhorizontally\" may not  always be appropriate for a non-luffing jib. Third, tower cranes do not  always rotate \nabout the tower center to swing loads. There are \"top  slewing\" tower cranes--those in which the w orking \nboom rotates on the  top of a fixed tower, and \"bottom slewing\" tower cranes --those in  which the tower \nitself (with the working boom fixed to it) rotates on  its base, and for the latter, the boom does not rotate \nabout the tower  center. OSHA requested public comment on the changes it made to the  Committee draft \ndefinition.     One commenter agreed with the proposed definition of \"tower  crane,\" saying that OSHA's \nchanges removed any ambiguity in the  definition. (ID -0187.1.) Three commenters suggested adding the \nwords  \"or near vertical\" to the first sentence of the definition so that it  would say, \"a type of lifting structure \nwhich util izes a vertical, or  near vertical, mast or tower. * * *\" (ID -0180.1; -0205.1; -0213.1.)  These \ncommenters were evidently concerned that a tower crane could,  under Sec.  1926.1435(b)(5), Plumb \ntolerance, permissibly deviate from  being perfectly vertical by a slight amount. As explained below in the  \ndiscussion of Sec.  1926.1435(b)(5), the crane's tower must be plumb to  the manufacturer's tolerance or, \nwhere the manufacturer does not  specify the plumb tolerance, plumbed to a tolerance of at least 1:500.      \nOSHA concludes that adding the words \"or near vertical\" to the  definition of tower crane is not necessary. \nAlthough a tower crane may  deviate from being perfectly vertical by the amount of the  manufacturer's \ntolerance or, where the manufacturer does not specify a  tolerance, at least 1:500, the tower crane would still \nbe \"vertical\"  within the ordinary meaning of that word.",
    "6d277d63-14ab-4d61-a2bb-4db38e24d216": "page_label: 48\nfile_name: OSHA-Final Rule-Cleaned.pdf\nfile_path: C:\\Users\\bs44876\\Desktop\\Project\\CII-Crane\\FineEmb\\dataset\\data\\OSHA-Final Rule-Cleaned.pdf\nfile_type: application/pdf\nfile_size: 3496317\ncreation_date: 2025-01-07\nlast_modified_date: 2025-01-07\n\nmanufacturer's specifications for adequate support and degree of level  of the equipment are met. A crane's \nstability depends (in part) on the  crane being level, and \"degree of level\" is a term used in the  industry to \ndescribe the manufacturer's specification for how level the  crane must be. The Agency determined that the \ntext of the proposed rule  did not make it clear that the drainage requirement did not apply to  \nmarshes/wetlands. Accordingly, the final rule's text has been modified  to clearly state that this is the only \nexception. All other conditions  related to have a stable surface for the equipment is applicable. -----------------\n----------------------------------------------------------      \\10\\ Note that \"used\" is not limited to use of the equipment  \nat a fixed location; it also includes when the equipment is  traveling with a load. --------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------      In the Committee's experience, crane tip -over incidents caused by  \ninadequate ground conditions are a significant cause of injuries and  fatalities. For example, on September 28, \n1999, a 19 year old  electrical instrument helper was killed by a crane that overturned  because insufficient \ncare was taken to ensure that the ground under the  crane was firm and that the crane's outriggers were \nproperly supported.  (ID-0017.13.) Conditions that enhance the chance of such accidents  include ground \nthat is wet  or muddy, poorly graded, or that is loose  fill (or otherwise disturbed soil) that has not been \ncompacted. The  Committee determined that requiring adequate ground conditions will  prevent many of \nthese accidents. The exception for marshes and wetlands  is included because the Committee was aware that, \nin many instances,  the draining of marshes/wetlands is prohibited or restricted by  environmental laws and \nthere are devices available (such as marsh  buggies) that are designed to provide adequate support to cranes \nin  such areas.     One commenter suggested that the term \"level\" could be confusing  and suggested that \nit be defined as \"less than one degree of grade  change or as required by the manufacturer.\" (ID-0178.1.) OSHA \nfinds  this comment unpersuasi ve. The suggested language is circular because  it does not use the term \n\"level\" by itself; it refers to \"the  equipment manufacturer's specifications for * * * degree of level of  the \nequipment.\" The reason the provision refers to the manufacturer's  specification in this regard is that it is the \nmanufacturer that  establishes the load chart, and the load chart is valid only for the  parameters, including \ndegree of level, established by the manufacturer.     At the public hearing, a representative of the r ailroad \nindustry  raised an issue that OSHA determines could be the source of some  confusion. The commenter \nindicated that the railroad industry regularly  has to work in out -of-level conditions, since some sections of \ntrack  are not level. (ID-0342.) The commenter explained that the  manufacturers of track-mounted cranes \nprovide specialized load charts  which take into account these out -of-level conditions.      The \nmanufacturers of these cranes apparently specify that the  cranes can be used in certain out -of-level \ncircumstances, as evidenced  by their provision of load charts for those conditions. Therefore, the  use of \nequipment in accordance with manufactu rer specifications  regarding degree of level would meet Sec.  \n1926.1402(b)'s requirement  because the provision permits use of the equipment in accordance with  those \nspecifications. Paragraph (c)     Under Sec.  1926.1402(c), the controlling entity has several  specific duties \nregarding ground conditions. OSHA's authority to impose  these duties is discussed in detail in the preamble \nto the proposed  rule (see 73 FR 59731-59732, Oct. 9, 2008), and the Agency re-asserts  the same authority \nwith respect to the final rule. As it did with  respect to the proposed rule, the Agency is again stating that the  \nduties imposed on the controlling entity through the promulgation of  this final rule are supplemental to, and \ndo not displace, controlling  entity duties u nder OSHA's multi -employer policy. (See Sec.   1926.1402(e), \ndiscussed below; 73 FR 59731, Oct. 9, 2008).      \"Controlling entity\" is defined in Sec.",

(ID-0342.) \nThe witness explained that  the proposed system would require the serial number of parts that  failed to be \nreported to the manufacturer so that localities such as  New York City could contac t the manufacturer to \ndetermine whether a  particular crane was safe to operate within that jurisdiction.\\135\\ ---------------------------\n------------------------------------------------      \\135\\ This commenter also called for prototype testing of tower  \ncranes. (ID -0156.1.) As explained in Sec.  1926.1433, OSHA has added  such a requirement to Sec.  \n1926.1433(c).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      OSHA is not promulgating \nrequirements to implement the system  proposed by this witness. Such a scheme is complex, and appears to  \nrequire the development of new tracking systems and required reporting  to manufacturers that might be \nbeyond the scope of OSHA's authority. It  also goes far beyond any provisions of the proposed standard, and \nits  adoption would require OSHA to reopen the rulemaking record to allow  other interested persons to \ncomment on it. OSHA does not conclude that  such a reopening is justified on the basis of the witness's \ntestimony.  The Agency notes, however, that it is not preempting a locality's  authority to establish such a \nscheme within its jurisdiction. (See  discussion of preemption under federalism in section V.D of this  \npreamble.) Section 1926.1436 Derricks     This section contains requirements for derricks that supplement \nthe  other requirements of this standard. Subpart N, at former Sec.   1926.550(e), required derricks to \ncomply with applicable provisions for  design, construction, installation, inspectio n, testing, maintenance,  \nand operation in ANSI B30.6-1969, safety code for \"Derricks,\" as well  as the general provisions of subpart N \nthat applied to all equipment.     C-DAC's experience, and its review of injury and fatality  statistics, did not \nindicate a need to deviate significantly from the  requirements of subpart N. For the most part, the most \nrecent version  of the ANSI standard, ASME B30.6-2003, does not differ substantively  from the 1969 version, \nso the requirements of this new section differ  substantively in only limited respects from previous subpart N. \nWhere  substantive differences exist, they are discussed in the context of  that requirement. Paragraph (a)     \nSection 1926.1436 contains supplemental requirements for derricks,  whether temporarily or permanently \nmounted; all sections of this  subpart apply to derricks unless specified otherwise. Section  1926.1436(a) \ndefines a derrick as powered equipment consisting of a  mast or equivalent member that is held at or near \nthe end by guys or  braces, with or without a boom, and its hoisting mechanism. The mast/  equivalent \nmember and/or the load is moved by the hoisting mechanism  (typically base-mounted) and operating ropes. \nDerricks include: A - frame, basket, breast, Chicago boom, gin pole (e xcept gin poles used  for erection of \ncommunication towers), guy, shearleg, stiffleg, and  variations of such equipment.      Paragraph (a) \nexcludes the gin poles when used for the erection of  communication towers. This mirrors the exclusion of \nsuch equipment from  the scope of the standard under Sec.  1926.1400(c)(12). See discussion  of this \nexclusion in Sec.  1926.1400(c)(12). No comments were received;  therefore this provision is promulgated as \nproposed. Paragraph (b) Operation --Procedures     Paragraph (b)(1) of this section states that Sec.  \n1926.1417  (Operation) of this standard applies to derricks except for Sec.   1926.1417(c) (Accessibility of \nprocedures). C-DAC concluded and OSHA  agreed that it was appropriate to keep the operation requirements \nfor  derricks consistent with those of cranes as much as possible because  they both present many of the \nsame hazards and operational issues.  However, Sec.",

Second,  routes for the loads must be pre-planned \nto ensure that no employee is  required to work in the fall zone except for employees necessary for  the \nhooking or unhooking of the load. The reason for generally  requiring hooks to be equipped with latches is to \nprevent the load from  accidentally disengaging from the hook. C -DAC determined that the use  of hooks \nwith latches is an industry recognized practice, but also  recognized that there are some circumstances where \nthe use of a hook  with a latch presents a greater hazard. The exceptions in Sec.   1926.1433(d)(4)(ii) are \nincluded to address the latter circumstances.  For example, if an employee would have to climb up or out onto \nan  unsecured, elevated member to unhook the load after its placement, the  employee would be exposed \nto a fall hazard. The criteria in Sec.   1926.1433(d)(4)(ii) for permitting a hook to be used without a latch  are \ndesigned to ensure that the operation can still be conducted  safely.

(ID-0342.) In addition, the witness explained  \nthat the railroad industry uses a variety of construction equipment,  some on the tracks (locomotive cranes, \nrubber-tired off-road cranes  that are capable of being used on the tracks) and others off the tracks  (rubber-\ntired off road cranes, truck cranes, and service trucks). (ID- 0342.) The witness estimated that 95% of railroad \nindustry crane  operations take place on or around railroad tracks. (ID-0342.)     One commenter expressed \nconcern about the application of Sec.   1926.1402 to the railroad industry's use of cranes and requested an  \nexemption for the use of cranes on and alongside tracks. (ID-0176.1; - 0292.1.) The commenter expressed two \nspecific concerns. First, that,  unlike most construction sites, a railroad construction site may  include many \nmiles of railroad track. The commenter elaborated that the  time and cost associated with locating and \nchecking site drawings and  soil analyses --which the commenter said may arguably be available to  the \nrailroad industry--for thousands of miles of track would be  \"exorbitant\" and would \"not appreciably lower \nthe risks to the crane  operator.\" (ID-0176.1.)     As for the cost associated with locating and checking \ndocuments,  Sec.  1926.1402 does not require the controlling entity to possess or  acquire any particular \ndocuments or other information, but requires  that the controlling entity share any information about \nunderground  hazards that it has in its possession with the crane user and operator.  As explained above, \nOSHA has replaced \"available to\" with \"in the  possession of\" to make this clear.      The commenter also \nsuggested that there is no need to apply Sec.   1926.1402 to cranes used by railroads along track rights of way \nbecause  the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has regulations that specify  minimum requirements for \nroadbeds and areas immediately adjacent to  roadbeds that concern the ground conditions underneath and \nalongside  the track, as well as requirements for how the track must be laid.      The Fed eral Railroad \nAdministration has established requirements  for the ballasts beneath railroad tracks, \\13\\ limited \nrequirements for  the roadbed,\\14\\ and requirements for the track surface. \\15\\ The  failure of any one of \nthese elements (the ballast, the roadbed or sub- grade, or the track) is detrimental to the effectiveness of the \nsystem  as a whole. These provisions are designed to, in concert, enable trains  to travel safely, and involve \nconditions adjacent to the track only to  the extent that they affect track stability. ------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------      \\13\\ The FRA regulations for the ballast (the foundation f or  most \nrailroad tracks) can be found at 49 CFR 213.103 and 213.334,  depending on the class of track. The provisions \nare otherwise  identical, and provides:     Unless it is otherwise structurally supported, all track shall  be \nsupported by material which will--     (a) Transmit and distribute the load of the track and railroad  rolling \nequipment to the subgrade;     (b) Restrain the track laterally, longitudinally, and vertically  under dynamic \nloads imposed by railroad rolling equipment and  thermal str ess exerted by the rails;      (c) Provide \nadequate drainage for the track; and      (d) Maintain proper track crosslevel, surface, and alignment.      \n\\14\\ FRA requirements address issues other than ground support  in the area adjacent to the track roadbed. \nSpecifically, 49 CFR  213.31 requires that each drainage or other water carrying facility  under or immediately \nadjacent to the roadbed be maintained and kept  free of obstruction, to accommodate expected water flow \nfor the area  concerned. Section 213.37 requires the control of vegetation on  railroad property which is on \nor immediately adjacent to roadbeds to  prevent fires, maintain visibility and signals, and to prevent  \ninterference with other duties.      \\15\\ 49 CFR 213.51 et seq. contains requirement s for the gage,  \nalignment, and surface of the track.",

This  paragraph applies when hoisting employees solely for such transfer.     Section \n1926.1431(r)(1) requires the employer to use either a  traditional personnel platform or a marine -hoisted \npersonnel transfer  device. This paragraph allows an employer to use a marine -hoisted  personnel transfer \ndevice instead of a personnel platform for several  reasons. Transferring personnel to or from a ma rine \nconstruction site  poses special problems due to the effects of waves and gusting wind.  These effects, which \ncan be unpredictable, can result in a situation  where the equipment operator will not be able to adequately \ncontrol the  equipment. In such a situation, the device used to transfer the  employees may suddenly wind \nup in the water. Another situation is when  employees may need to jump into the water to avoid a collision \nwith the  ship or an object on the construction site. A third situation is when  the operator is unable to control \nthe equipment while the employees are  attempting to board or disembark. The longer it takes to get on or \noff,  the greater this risk becomes. In all of these scenarios the employees  need to be able to enter and exit \nthe device being used to transfer  them quickly and easily.     A personnel platform, which is designed, in \npart, to keep the  employees inside, would, in most marine situations, compound the hazard  faced by the \nemployees, since they can be difficult to  enter and exit  quickly. In contrast, a marine -hoisted personnel \ntransfer device is  designed specifically to facilitate the employees' rapid entry and  exit. The employer has \nthe option of using such a device so that it may  be used when the conditions are such that the risk of being \nprevented  from entering or exiting quickly is greater than the risk of  unintentionally falling.     In the \nproposed rule, OSHA requested public comment on whether  paragraph (r)(1) should require the employer to \nfirst establish that  use of a marine -hoisted personnel-transfer device was not less safe  than a personnel \nplatform. No comments were received on this issue.     Paragraph (r)(2) requires the employer to follow the \nrequirements  of paragraphs (a) through (n) of Sec.  1926.1431 when using a personnel  platform to hoist \nemployees. As discussed previously, these provisions  are designed to ensure that hoisting per sonnel is the \nsafest means of  the employees gaining access to the work and that the personnel  platform's design and use \nare adequate from a safety standpoint.     Paragraph (r)(3) establishes the requirements when the employer  \nelects to use a marine -hoisted personnel -transfer device instead of a  personnel platform for hoisting \npersonnel.     Paragraph (r)(3)(i) identifies which of the provisions in  Sec. Sec.  1926.1431 (a) through (q) \napply when using a marine -hoisted  personnel-transfer device. For th e applicable provisions, the phrase  \n\"marine-hoisted personnel-transfer device\" is substituted for either  \"personnel platform\" or \"platform.\"      \nThe Sec.  1926.1431 paragraphs not listed in Sec.  1926.1431  (r)(3)(i) do not apply when a marine-hoisted \npersonnel-transfer device  is used. This is because those requirements are either specifically  applicable to \npersonnel platform design and use, or are otherwise not  relevant when hoisting personnel at a marine \nworksite.     Paragraph (r)(3)(ii) requires th e marine -hoisted personnel -transfer  device to be used \nexclusively for transferring employees. One purpose  of this provision is to prevent the device from being used \nas a work  platform. The device's design, which specifically facilitates easy and  rapid entry and exit, is ill \nsuited to providing a safe work platform.  In particular, it is not designed to prevent a fall when an employee \nis  using his or her hands for working rather than holding on to the  device. Also, it is ill suited as a material \ntransfer device because it  is not designed to prevent materials from falling from it, and could be  damaged \nby such use.      Paragraph(r)(3)(iii) limits the number of employees on the marine - hoisted personnel-\ntransfer device to the maximum number the device is  designed to hold.",

(ID-0344.) Institutions of higher  education cannot revoke \nor repossess diplomas.      The representative explained that a key difference between  educational \naccreditation and personnel accreditation is surveillance  of the test administration process by the accrediting \nbody to ensure  that an individual's score is not tainted by prior knowledge of the  examination or by lack of \nsecurity during the test itself. Using the  ANSI accreditation process as an example, he explai ned that a  \ncertification entity seeking accreditation will undergo annual  surveillance--onsite during the first and third \nyears, which can  encompass multiple sites if the certification entity's structure merits  such review. ANSI \nexamines the controls over test items and the  development of test items, to ensure that these items are not \nreleased  to the public. ANSI also looks to ensure that the organizational  structure of the certifying entity is \nreflective of the population it  is intended to serve, and that the administration is fair and equitable  among \nall the applicants. These criteria are not required elements of  accreditation for higher education institutions, \naccording to both the  representative and Department of Education materials (see 34 CF R part 602).      \nThere is another reason why certification by an educational  institution would, in most cases, not be suitable \nfor crane operators:  The need for personnel testing to be independent of the training that  precedes the \ntesting. As discussed below, Sec.  1926.1427(g) of this  rule is designed to ensure that training is separate \nfrom testing to  prevent an organization that offers both services from defeating the  validity of the test by \n\"teaching to the test.\" OSHA acknowledges  that it might be possible for an educational institution to provide \nthe  necessary \"firewalls\" between its training and testing, and obtain  the separate accreditation required \nunder this section, such that it  could comply with Sec.  1926.1427(g). However, educational institutions  \ntypically both teach and test, and may do so within their educational  accreditation without any requirement \nthat the testing process be  insulated from the teaching process.     The purpose of a personnel certification \ntest is different from a  test offered by an educational institution, which is to determine  whether the \nindividual has mastered the material that was taught. As a  labor representative stated at the hearing, \npersonnel certification  tests examine a random sampling of information that individuals must  know to \nperform the function being tested. (ID -0341.) The labor  representative pointed out that if the individual is \ntested only on the  material he or she has been taught, the individual learns only the  information needed to \npass the test and the test is not a reliable  measure of the person's depth of knowledge on the subject. \nTherefore,  allowing educational institutions to certify crane operators based  solely on thei r DoE \naccreditation would be inconsistent with the  principle that testing for certification purposes should be \nindependent  of any training that the individual has received and would severely  compromise the reliability \nof the certification process.      In sum, the DoE accreditation system for educational institutions  is not \ndesigned to assess the capabilities that are needed for  developing or administering personnel competency \ntests.\\117\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\117\\ At least one other Federal \nagency has also taken this view  of certification. The Department of Defense requires the  certification of \ncertain personnel performing Information Assurance  functions within that organization. Appendix 2 to DoD \n8570.01-M, the  directive addressing such certifications, requires that the  certifications must be accredited, \nand maintain accreditation, under  ISO 17024. (ID-0346.1.) ------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------      Moreover, concerns about inadequate availability of certifying  entities are unfounded. At the \ntime of the proposed rule, two testing  organizations, NCCCO and the Southern Ca lifornia Crane & Hoisting  \nAssociation, had been accredited (see 73 FR 59812, Oct. 9, 2008). By  the time of the hearing, four additional",

(ID-0145.1; -0151.1; - 0194.1; -0214.1.) \nSeveral commenters who opposed the suggestion stated  that such certification would likely not be available \nfrom testing  organizations, that employers who use Option (2) would find it costly  and impractical to \ndevelop tests for each model of crane, and that  testing based on crane model was not appropriate because \nthe skill set  and knowledge required for safe operation are not model -dependent. (ID- 0175.2; -0205.1; -\n0213.1.) Witnesses at the hearing also opposed model- specific certification. (ID-0341; -0343.)     OSHA has \nconcluded that expansion of the options to include  certification on a specific model of crane is not necessary. \nThe body  of knowledge and skills required to be qualified/certified on a  particular model of crane is not less \nthan that needed to be qualified/  certified for that model's type and capacity.

Another method is to set up a personal \nfall arrest system  that would arrest the employee's fall before hitting the n ext lower  level by using \nstanchions to support an elevated, horizontal life-line.  However, such stanchions must be securely fastened \nand whatever they  are fastened to must be able to withstand considerable forces in an  arrested fall. On a \ncrane's lattice boom, the stanchions would have to  be attached either to the chords or the lacings.     The \nchords and lacings are engineered to be as light as possible,  and an engineering analysis would be needed in \neach case to determine  if the attachment point was sufficiently strong to withstand those  forces. Also, the \nAgency determines that manufacturers would be  unlikely to approve clamp-on type systems because of the \nlikelihood of  the clamping forces damaging these critical structural components.  Similarly, the Agency",

The \nexception reduces  the extent to wh ich Sec.  1926.502 applies to work covered under subpart  CC, and \nclarifies that subpart CC generally sets forth the criteria for  the fall protection systems required under subpart \nCC.     Section 1926.500(a)(4) stated that Sec.  1926.503 sets forth the  requirements for training in the \ninstallation and use of fall  protection systems, except in relation to steel erection activities.  The Agency \nadded the phrase \"and the use of equipment covered by  subpart CC\" at the end of the exception to make \nclear that the fall  protection training requirements in Sec.  1926.503 of subpart M do not  apply to fall \nprotection systems when used to comply with subpart CC.  Training for fall protection systems required by \nsubpart CC is governed  by Sec.  1926.1423(k).   Subpart N--Helicopters, Hoists, Elevators, and Conveyors       \nThe heading of subpart N has been changed to \"Helicopters, Hoists,  Elevators, and Conveyors.\" The revision \nof the heading reflects both  the equipment that is now regulated by subpart N and the removal of  sections \nregulating cranes and derricks from subpart N to subpart CC.  Amendments to Sec.  1926.550       Cranes \nand derricks used in construction had been regulated by  Sec.  1926.550. Subpart CC is now the applicable \nstandard for  regulating the use of cranes and derricks in construction. Section  1926.550 has been \nredesignated as Sec.  1926.1501 and reserved.   Amendments to Sec.  1926.553       OSHA revised Sec.  \n1926.553 to include a new provision, Sec.   1926.553(c). This section explains that Sec.  1926.553 does not \napply  to base-mounted drum hoists used in conjunction with derricks. Instead,  base-mounted drum hoists \nused with derricks must conform to the  requirements of Sec.  1926.1436. This change was made in response \nto a  request by a commenter who wanted to clarify that the requirements for  base-mounted drum hoists \nused with derricks could be found in new  subpart CC. (ID -0130.1.) No information was submitted to the \nrecord  that indicates OSHA should not make the revision to Sec.  1926.553.     OSHA determined that the \nrevision addresses the commenter's  concerns regarding the applicability of Sec.  1926.553 and enhances \nthe  clarity of the final rule. This revision ensures that base -mounted drum  hoists used in the design of \nderricks meet the updated requirements of  ASME B30.7-2001, which is referenced in Sec.  1926.1436. The \nolder ANSI  B30.7-1968, which is referenced in Sec.  1926.553, continues to apply  to all base -mounted \ndrum hoists not used in conjunction with derricks.   Subpart O--Motorized Vehicles, Mechanical Equipment, \nand Marine  Operations  Amendments to Sec.  1926.600      This section regulates motor vehicles, \nmechanized equipment, and  marine o perations. Prior to the promulgation of this final rule, Sec.   \n1926.600(a)(6) referenced Sec.  1926.550(a)(15), which has been  redesignated and reserved. Because the \nAgency inadvertently did not  propose any revision of Sec.  1926.600(a)(6), OSHA is pres erving the  same \nrequirements imposed by former Sec.  1926.550(a)(15) pursuant to  this section by incorporating language \nsubstantively identical to that  of former Sec.  1926.550(a)(15) into revised Sec.  1926.600(a)(6). The  \nrevision of Sec.  1926.600(a) (6) does not alter any of the substantive  requirements of that section, does not \nchange any existing rights or  obligations, and no member of the regulated community is likely to  object to \nit.",

Since there are firms that specialize in repairing  cranes damaged in accidents, the \nAgency believes that they are in fact  frequent. If the cost of these kinds of accidents are only, on average,  \n$100,000 each, the total annual cost savings from avoiding two-thirds  (the fraction of current crane fatalities \nprevented by the final  standard) of them would be about $7 million per year. That represents a  cost saving \nof avoiding accidents from just one cause. Although  tipovers and crane or boom collapses are likely the most \nexpensive type  of crane a ccident, they represent only about 10 percent of the types of  fatal accidents.     \nTower crane collapses in urban areas, while infrequent, are very  costly, as the crane is typically lost, \nconsiderable damage done to the  worksites and structures beyond, and days if not weeks of lost  production. \nThe Agency believes that this cost is significant, but has  no information in the record with which to estimate",

While there may be no available tie -off point  during new construction, construction activities \nsometimes take place  in storage tanks, concrete shafts and chimneys after the structure is  in place. \nTherefore, the requirement has been changed to add a sentence  specifying that when there is no adequate \nstructure for attachment of  personal fall arrest equipment as required in Sec.  1926.502(d)(15),  the \npersonal fall arrest equipment should be attached to the lower load  block or to the overhaul ball.      \nSection 1926.1431(s)(3)(iv) requires fall protection equipment to  comply with Sec.  1926.502, Fall protection \nsystems criteria and  practices. This ensures that the fall equipment is sufficient to safely  arrest the \nemployee's fall.     Section 1926.1431(s)(3)(v) requires the boatswain's chair to be  capable of supporting, \nwithout failure, its own weight plus a minimum  of five times the maximum intended load. This is consistent \nwith the  requirement for personnel platforms at Sec.  1926.1431(e)(4).      Section 1926.1431(s)(3)(vi) \nmandates that only one person be  hoisted at a time when using a boatswain's chair. No comments were  \nreceived on paragraphs (s)(3)(iv) through (s)(3)(vi); they a re  promulgated as proposed. Section 1926.1432 \nMultiple-Crane/Derrick Lifts      Final Sec.  1926.1432 lists additional requirements for operations  \ninvolving multiple cranes and derricks. As discussed in the proposed  rule preamble, this section addresses \nhazards arising from operations  that use more than one crane/derrick to lift a load (see 73 FR 59840- 59841, \nOct. 9, 2008). After reviewing comments on the proposed rule,  the Agency is promulgating Sec. Sec.  \n1926.1432(a) and 1926.1432(b)(1)  as proposed. Section 1926.1432(b)(2) is nearly identical to the  proposed \ntext, but includes the following changes: the use of the terms  \"directed\" and \"lift director\" instead of \n\"supervised\" and  \"supervisor,\" respectively, and language to clarify that the lift  director must review the \nmultiple crane/derrick lift plan with all  workers \"in a meeting.\"     Several commenters expressed the view \nthat OSHA should add specific  requirements and procedures for the protection of employees engaged in  \n\"critical lifts,\" which were not addressed separately in the proposed  rules. (ID-0182.1; -0207.1.) One of these \ncommenters requested that  OSHA add \"critical lifts\" to the title of Sec.  1926.1432, and define  \"critical \nlift\" to include any lift that exceeds 75 percent of the  rated capacity of the crane or derrick, requires the use \nof more than  one crane or derrick, involves hoisting personnel, or is otherwise  determined by a qualified \nperson to involve an exceptional level of  risk. (ID-0182.1.) OSHA disagrees with these c ommenters for the \nreasons  discussed below.     C-DAC specifically considered whether to use the term \"critical  lift\" for \ntriggering additional requirements, such as planning and  oversight. (OSHA-S030-2006-0663-0485.) There are \na variety of differing  views as to what ought to be considered a critical lift in this regard.  For example, the \nArmy Corps of Engineers, in its 2008 U.S. Army Corps  of Engineers Safety and Health Requirements Manual, \ndefines \"critical  lift\" as \"a non-routine crane lift requiring detailed planning and  additional or unusual safety \nprecautions.\" This manual describes  critical lifts, in part, as lifts: (1) In which the load weighs 75% of  the \nrated capacity of the crane; in which the load is out of the  operator's view; involving more than one crane; \ninvolving non-routine  or technically difficult rigging arrangement; hoisting personnel with a  crane or derrick; \nor that the crane operator believes should be  considered critical.

(ID-0143.1.) It also believes listing this  requirement in \nthe elements for shift inspections is confusing and  suggests that this requirement should either be removed \nor included in  Sec.  1926.1402, Ground Conditions. As stated in the explanation of the  proposed rule, this \nitem was included because ground conditions can  change from shift to shift, and sufficient ground support is \nof  critical importance for safety. OSHA is retaining it in this section  because it is more appropriately included \nin the list of items to be  inspected than as a stand -alone inspection item in Sec.  1926.1402.      In \nparagraph (d)(1)(x) in the final rule, OSHA is replacing the  word \"outriggers\" with \"outriggers/stabilizers.\" The \nterm  \"stabilizers\" was added because some pieces of equipm ent, like  articulating cranes, are designed to \nuse stabilizers instead of  outriggers to add stability at their bases. A full discussion of the  comments that \nprompted this regulatory text change is provided in the  explanation of the rule for Sec.  1926. 1404(q).     \nProposed Sec.  1926.1412(d)(1)(xi) included among the items to be  inspected \"the equipment for level \nposition, both shift and after each  move and setup.\" The SBREFA Panel recommended that OSHA solicit public  \ncomment about whether it is necessary to clarify the requirement of  proposed Sec.  1926.1412(d)(1)(xi) that \nthe equipment be inspected for  \"level position\" by clarifying the amount of tolerance that would be  allowed \nfor the equipment to be considered \"level.\" OSHA requested  public comment on this issue and several \ncommenters asked OSHA not to  specify tolerance limits. (ID -0143.1; -0170; -0205; -0213; -0226.) OSHA  \nnotes that Sec.  1926.1402(b), which pertain s to ground conditions,  requires the equipment, during use, to \nbe level to the degree specified  by the equipment manufacturer. For clarity, OSHA is adding language to  Sec.  \n1926.1412(d)(1)(xi) to state that the equipment must be inspected  for level position \"within the tolerances \nspecified by the equipment  manufacturer's recommendations.\" OSHA is also adding the words  \"before \neach\" before shift to clarify the provisions intent.      Paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) require the employer to \ntake  corrective action where the competent person identifies a deficiency  during inspection. Once the \ninspector identifies any deficiency in the  areas in (d)(1)(i) through (xiii),\\72\\ or pursuant to other equipment- \nspecific inspections (e.g., Sec.  1926.1436(p) (inspec tion of  derricks)), the inspector must immediately \ndetermine whether that  deficiency constitutes a safety hazard. If so, then equipment  operations must cease \nand the employer must take the equipment out of  service, following the tag -out procedure in Se c.  \n1926.1417(f), and may  not use it again until the deficiency has been corrected. This approach  reflects C-\nDAC's determination that not all deficiencies constitute  safety hazards. However, regardless of whether the \ninspector determines  that there is a safety hazard, if any deficiency affects a safety  device or operational \naid, then the employer must take the steps  required under Sec. Sec.  1926.1415, Safety Devices, or \n1926.1416,  Operational aids. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\72\\ Proposed \nSec.  1926.1412(d)(2) inadvertently referred to  deficiencies in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (xiv), but the \npreamble  to the proposed rule explained correctly that it only applied to  deficiencies in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) \nthrough (xiii) (not (xiv)) (73  FR 59770, Oct. 9, 2008). The text of paragraph (xiv) addresses  operational aides \nand safety devices, which are specifica lly  addressed in paragraph (d)(3).",

If this provision were mov ed to the Design, construction  and testing section, it would no \nlonger be considered a safety device.  If it was not functioning, it would be left to the competent person  \nconducting the shift and monthly inspections (and the qualified person  conducting the annual inspection) to \ndetermine if the deficiency  constituted a safety hazard (see, e.g., Sec.  1926.1412(d)(2)). C -DAC  \ndetermined, and OSHA agrees, that an integral holding device/check  valve is essential for the safe operation \nof hydraulic outrigger jacks  and therefore needs to be designated as a safety device.      Rail Clamps and \nRail Stops: Paragraph (a)(6) specifies that  equipment on rails have rail clamps and rail stops, except for portal  \ncranes. (See the discussion of this provision in 73 FR 59786, Oct. 9,  2008.) OSHA received no comment on this \nprovision. Therefore, it is  promulgated as proposed.     Horn: In the proposed rule, a horn was not listed \nas a safety  device. One commenter requested that the standard require a horn. (ID - 0156.1.) ASME B30.5-\n2004 requires that an \"audible signal device\" be  provided, within reach of the operator. OSHA agrees that a \nhorn is an  important safety feature; it is typically a standard feature on cranes  and is used to warn workers \nof imminent dangers. Therefore, OSHA has  included a horn in the list of safety devices in Sec.  \n1926.1415(a)(7)  of the final rule.     The horn need not be permanently installed on the equipment, but it  \nmust be in a location where the operator can access and use it  immediately to warn workers of imminent \ndanger. An operator may use a  removable device, such as a hand -held air horn that is stored near the  \noperator in a manner that would not interfe re with the operation of the  equipment, if it satisfies those \nrequirements.     OSHA is also requiring in Sec.  1926.1415(a)(7)(ii) that built -in  (i.e., integral) horns be \nremoved or tagged out when they are not  working properly. Similarly, a removable horn must be removed \nfrom the  equipment when it is not working properly. As noted in the previous  paragraph, the operator \nwould be permitted to resume operation if an  operational horn, such as a hand-held air horn, is added to the \ncab in  the proper location. It is therefore critical that the operator, and  operators in subsequent shifts, not \nbe confused about which horn is  operational. A non-operational horn must be tagged out or removed,  prior \nto the resumption of operation, to avoid the operator's  inadvertent reliance on the nonoperational horn. The \nhorn is often  required when an unexpected hazard presents itself, and the operator  must therefore locate \nand use it quickly. Paragraph (b) Proper Operation Required     Paragraph (b) prohibits the operation of the \nequipment if any of  the safety devices listed in this section are not in proper working  order. Under OSHA's \nexisting Sec.  1926.20(b)(3), employers must tag  out or remove any equipment that is not in compliance \nwith any  applicable requirement in part 1926. In Sec.  1926.1417(f), OSHA makes  it clear that when \nequipment is \"taken out of service,\" the employer must  place a tag in the cab to provide clear notice to al l \nemployees that the  equipment is out of service. To avoid any potential ambiguity about whether  equipment \nis \"taken out of service\" when its operation is prohibited because  of an inoperational safety device, OSHA is \ninserting new text in Sec.  1926.141 5(b)  and a cross reference to Sec.  1926.1417 (Operation). Specifically, \nfinal  paragraph (b)(2) requires that equipment be \"taken out of service\"  when one of the safety devices in \nSec.  1926.1415 is not operating  properly.",

This paragraph of the  proposed \nrule was originally titled and related to base-mounted drum  hoists. However, a tank building institute whose \nmembers use derricks  routinely commented that confusion will result in their industry from  the use of the \nterm \"Base -Mounted Drum Hoists,\" in this context. (ID - 0130.1.) Hoists used are not limited to the base -\nmounted type. The  commenter requested that the regulatory text of Sec.  1926.1436(e)(2)  be revised to \nreplace the words \"base mounted drum hoi sts\" with the  word \"hoist\" to eliminate ambiguity.      OSHA \ndetermines that it is appropriate to revise Sec.   1926.1436(e)(2) to replace the reference to \"base-mounted \ndrum hoist\"  with the term \"hoist.\" This revision recognizes that there may be  designs of hoists, other than \nbase-mounted drum, that are used with  derricks.     Additionally, the commenter suggested that Sec.  \n1926.553 be  revised in conjunction with this final rule. (ID -0130.1.) See  discussion in the preamble",

However, these materials reduce that risk  substantially.) In practice, \nunder dry conditions no nmetallic fiber  rope typically satisfies the definition for nonconductive. \\32\\ The  \nAgency concludes that this guidance is sufficient to help employers  determine whether their tag lines meet \nthe definition and has  therefore, declined to specify test pro cedures in the final rule. The  provision is \npromulgated as proposed, without change.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \n\\32\\ Wet, muddy, or high humidity conditions can cause such rope  to stop being nonconductive. Similarly, \nthe presence of metal or  other conductive fibers or conductive sheaths or reinforcement would  render the \ntag line conductive.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  Paragraph (b)(3)     Under \nthis paragraph the employer is required to implement one of  five listed encroachment prevention measures \n(Sec.  1926.1407(b)(3)(i)  through (v)). The C ommittee concluded that the use of any one of these  \nmeasures, in combination with the required measures listed elsewhere in  Sec.  1926.1407(b), would be \nfeasible and effective in protecting  against encroachment. Specifically, the employer is required to  choose  \neither: (i) The use of a dedicated spotter; (ii) a proximity alarm;  (iii) a device that automatically warns the \noperator when to stop  (i.e., a range control warning device); (iv) a device that  automatically limits the range \nof movement of the e quipment; or (v) an  elevated: warning line, barricade, or line of signs, in view of the  \noperator, equipped with flags or similar high-visibility markings.  Providing the ability to choose among these \noptions gives the employer  flexibility so that it can  pick one that is well suited and efficient  in the \ncircumstances.     A definition of \"dedicated spotter (power lines)\" is included in  Sec.  1926.1401, \nDefinitions. A dedicated spotter must meet the signal  person qualification requirements of Sec.  1926 .1428 \nand his/her sole  responsibility must be to watch the separation between the power line  and the equipment, \nload line, and load, and to ensure through  communication with the operator that the applicable minimum \ndistance is  not breached.      When th e employer uses a dedicated spotter to prevent encroachment  \nunder this section, that person has the critical responsibility of  ensuring, through communication with the \noperator, that the equipment  maintains a specified minimum clearance distance from a power line.  This \ndefinition makes clear that the dedicated spotter cannot have any  other responsibilities.\\33\\ The dedicated \nspotter must have the  qualifications required of a signal person under Sec.  1926.1428,  discussed below. \nThose qualifications will ensure that the signal  person can communicate effectively with the operator.

The  phrase \"that detract him/her from this task\" incorrectly implied  that a dedicated spotter could \nhave other tasks provided those other  tasks did not distract the dedicated spotter from his/her task of  \nmaintaining the required separation between the power line and the  equipment, the load, and the load line. \nThis implication was  incorrect.

(ID-0292.1.) As noted  in the definition of \"dedicated spotter\" \nquoted above, although the  dedicated spotter must be a qualified signal person under the  requirements of \nSec.  1926.1428, that definition also mandates that the  sole responsibility of the dedicated spotter be to",

Even  after the four-year phase-in period of the \ngeneral certification  requirements, OSHA will continue to allow non -certified operators to  operate the \nequipment as operators -in-training in accordance with Sec.   1926.1427(f), discussed below.      Of the \nthree options available in the absence of State or local  licensing laws, Option (3) of this section is available \nonly to the  United States military for qualification of its employees. Further, as  discussed below, a number \nof commenters stated that Option (2) of this  section was not viable for many employers. However, Option (1) \nof this  section is available to all employers and will be the one that is most  widely used. Therefore, most of \nthe public comments and evidence  presented at the hearing addressed Option (1).      At the hearing, a \nwitness for an accredited testing organization  testified that the certification process embodied in Option (1)  \noriginated in the 1990s when private industry groups began an effort to  improve crane safety. The witness \nexplained that the industry  representatives involved with the organization are drawn from such  groups as \ncontractors, crane rental firms, labor unions, own ers, steel  erectors, manufacturers, construction firms, \ntraining consultants, and  insurance companies. (ID -0343.) The witness also explained that exam  \nmanagement committees meet throughout the year to ensure the continuing  fairness and integrity of the  \ntesting process. Finally, the witness  explained that certification promotes safety by ensuring that the  \ntraining an individual has received has succeeded in giving that  individual the knowledge and skills to operate \na crane safely. (ID- 0343.)     Many commenters and witnesses at the public hearing expressed  support for \nthe proposed rule's approach of requiring third party  verification of an operator's qualifications and for the \nrange of  options presented. A national safety organization expressed sup port for  the provision to ensure \nqualification and certification of operators.  (ID-0178.1.) A trade association stated that third party oversight \nwas  critical to create an effective and legitimate testing process and to  ensure that the training portion did \nnot have undue influence on the  testing process. (ID-0205.1.)     Similarly, another commenter supported \nthe proposed Q/C  requirements, emphasizing the importance of independent certification  of an operator's \nskill and knowledge by an accredited nationally  recognized third-party entity or organization. (ID -0169.1.) \nSimilar  views were expressed by other commenters. (ID-0158.1; -0160.1; -0173.1;  -0192.1; -0196.0; -0211.1; \n-0212.1; -0220.1; -0225.1; -0228.1; - 0241.1.)     A number of witnesses at the public hearing also supported \nthe  proposed requirement for third-party verification. A representative  from a crane rental company said \nthat, although they incur additional  cost to prove certification, they consider that cost an investment in  the \nsafety of their employees. (ID-0344.) A major crane user observed  both certified and non-certified operators \nand found that the certified  operators operated far more safely because of the more comprehe nsive  \ntraining required to become certified. (ID-0344.)     An insurance company representative and former crane \noperator  stated that his company believes that employers who certify their  operators have fewer accidents \nand that, as a result, his firm offers  companies it insures a ten percent discount if they have their  operators \ncertified. (ID-0343.) The representative believed that the  cost of certification was modest when compared to \nthe cost of  accidents. (ID-0343.) A representative from a crane rental company  testified that preparing for \nthe certification process allowed his  company to improve their operators' knowledge and ability to operate  \ncranes safely. (ID-0343.) A representative from a steel erection  company agreed that certification is important \nto both insurance  companies and employers because certification gives employers peace of  mind and \nreduces insurance costs. (ID -0344.)     Some commenters and witnesses opposed the proposed rule's  \nrequirement for qualification or certification of operators. A trade  association commented that the \nrequirements would not improve safety  more than having trained, qualified operators because many of the",

This specific work practice \nalone will prevent virtually all  fatalities associated with assembly/disassembly of lattice boom cranes.  \nSection 1926.1404(q) contains several provisions designed to ensure  that outriggers are deployed properly \nbefore lifting a load. In  addition, the operator qualification and certification requirement of  proposed Sec.  \n1926.1427, which is intended to ensure that operators  understand and follow the safety requirements for the \nequipment they  are operating, would help prevent this type of accident.     For informational purposes, as \nrequired by E.O. 12866 (also  following the guidance of OMB's Circular A -4), OSHA monetizes the  safety \nbenefits of standards. OSHA assigns a value of statistical life  (VSL) to fatalities prevented by the final standard \nof $8.7 million per  VSL. This estimate is based on the median value found by Viscusi and Aldy  in their 2003 \nreview ($7 million in 2000 dollars), adjusted by the GDP  implicit price deflator 2000 to 2010). The total \nmonetized value of preventing  22 fatalities annually is about $191.4 million. For accidents, OSHA uses a  \nwillingness-to-pay methodology to monetize the value of injuries avoided,  of $50,000 in 2000 dollars; which, \nwhen adjusted by the GDP deflator is about  $62,500 in 2010 dollars. Thus, the monetized annual value of an \nestimated 175  injuries avoided by the standard annually is about $10.9 million. The total  annual monetized \nvalue of avoided injuries and fatalities is about  $202.3 million.  Costs of Crane Accidents      Several \ncommenters noted that crane accidents represented a  substantial cost to employers in the crane industry. \n(ID-0341; -0342; - 0343; -0344.) In the PEA the Agency did not estimate cost savings from  avoiding crane \naccidents, but only estimated monetized benefits for  avoiding fatalities (the value of a statistical life, or VSL) \nor  injuries (a value based on willingness to pay). These cost savings do  not represent other losses associated \nwith accidents, such as  production time lost to provide medical services to injured employees,  damage to \ncranes, damage to the work site or beyond, damage to the load  materials or rigging, lost time in cleaning up \nand repairing damage to  the worksite, lost production time while the crane is removed,  repaired, or \nreplaced with a substitute. More obviously they do not  account for costs of crane accidents where no fatality \nor injury was  recorded. There are many more crane accidents that do not involve any  injury than those \nrepresented in the IMIS reports, and the Agency  concludes that the final s tandard will avoid these just as \neffectively  as the accidents where injuries occur.      For example, there were ten tipover accidents with \nfatalities in  OSHA's IMIS records for 2008, and data collected in the State of  California over a three year \nperiod showed that there were 35 (mobile)  crane tipovers for the single tipover accident fatality (Op cit. Yow,  \nPhilip, \"Crane Accidents 1997-1999 * * *.\"). Since California has  about ten percent of the U.S. population and \neconomy, this suggests  that there are on the order of 350 crane tipover accidents over a three  year period, \nor about 120 per year. Tipovers typically require crane  repair, lost production time for all employees at the \nsite, and  schedule delays. Since there are firms that specialize in repairing  cranes damaged in accidents, the \nAgency believes that they are in fact  frequent. If the cost of these kinds of accidents are only, on average,  \n$100,000 each, the total annual cost savings from avoiding two-thirds  (the fraction of current crane fatalities \nprevented by the final  standard) of them would be about $7 million per year. That represents a  cost saving \nof avoiding accidents from just one cause. Although  tipovers and crane or boom collapses are likely the most \nexpensive type  of crane a ccident, they represent only about 10 percent of the types of  fatal accidents.",

The qualified person for the annual inspectio n must have  expertise in all the areas \ncovered by the annual inspection, in  addition to general expertise regarding the equipment and vessel/  \nflotation device. This expertise will ensure that the operational  conditions are safe for employees, and, \ntherefore, OSHA is retaining  these requirements in the final rule.     Section 1926.1437(h)(4)(i)(C) requires \nan inspection of various  component parts of the vessel to determine if there is significant  corrosion, wear, \ndeterioration or deformation. The use o f the word  significant is to indicate that the functionality of these \ncomponents  is not impaired in any way due to exposure to the elements or use. The  Committee determined, \nand OSHA agrees, that these components are  essential to safe operation of the vessel and therefore critical \nto  employee safety.     A commenter indicated that the requirement to check for \"external  evidence of \nleaks and structural damage\" in Sec.   1926.1437(h)(4)(i)(C) should not apply below the waterline of the hull.  \n(ID-0345.26.) That commenter suggested that applying the requirement  below the waterline would be unduly \nburdensome because it would require  dry-docking the vessel. Another commente r, indicated that dry -\ndocking a  vessel is expensive--between $20,000 and $60,000 per dry -docking,  depending on the type of \nvessel. (ID-0344.1.) This cost estimate was  supported by another commenter, who noted the average cost for \nits  fleet was $50,000 to dry-dock a vessel. (ID-0383.1.) A commenter  indicated that industry practice is to \nconduct the routine annual  inspection from the waterline up, and that inspecting below the  waterline \nwould not enhance safety. (ID-0344.1.)     The Agency agrees that it is not necessary to require dry-docking  \non an annual basis. Instead, OSHA modified the language used in the  proposed rule to allow employers to \ncheck for leaks and damage below  the waterline inside the vessel/flotation device, by, for example,  opening \nhatches and access/inspection ports, but not by opening sealed  compartments or cutting openings.      \nParagraph (h)(4)(iii)(A) requires the removal from service of any  vessel/flotation device when a qualified \nperson determines a deficiency  in the equi pment constitutes a immediate hazard. As with other removal  \nfrom service requirements, OSHA is including a cross -reference to the  tag-out requirement in Sec.  \n1926.1417(f), which is triggered when  equipment is removed from service.     Paragraph (h)(5) requires an \ninspection every four years of the  internal portion of the barge, pontoons, vessel, or other means of  \nflotation by a marine engineer, marine architect, licensed surveyor, or  other qualified person who has \nexpertise with respect to vessels/flotation  devices. A higher level of expertise is necessary for performing the \nfour-year  inspection than the annual inspection. By listing \"other qualified  person\" together with \"marine \nengineer,\" \"marine architect,\" and  \"licensed surveyor,\" the Agency clarifies that the expertise of the  \"other \nqualified person\" must be equivalent to that of a marine  engineer, marine architect, or licensed surveyor. In \nthis regard, the  proposal did not list inspection items for the four -year inspection.  Instead, OSHA \ndetermines (based on C-DAC's recommendation) that a  better approach is to rely on the expert knowledge \nof the marine  engineer, marine architect, licensed s urveyor, or other qualified  person who has expertise \nwith respect to vessels/flotation devices.      OSHA received two comments regarding the use of the term  \n\"quadrennial\" in the proposed rule. (ID -0343; -0344.1.) Both  recommended using the term \"four -year\" \nbecause it is consistent with  current terminology used by the marine industry. In light of this  information \nOSHA revised the term \"quadrennial\" to \"four -year\" in  the final rule in paragraphs (h)(5) and (h)(6) of Sec.  \n1926.1437.",

However, this assumes that the \noperator is in fact standing  or sitting on the equipment. There may be some situations where this is  not the \ncase.

Fiber core ropes are more pliable  than ropes with a \nmetal core and are therefore suited to applications  requiring greater reverse bending, such as use on derricks. \nMoreover,  the distinction between derricks and cranes is consistent with current  national consensus \nstandards. The 2004 version of ASME B30.5, in sec.  5.1.7.2(b), prohibits the use of fiber core wire ropes for \nboom hoist  reeving for mobile and locomotive cranes. By contrast, the standard in  the ASME B30 series \nthat applies to derricks, ASME B30.6-2003, does not  prohibit the use of fiber core wire rope for boom hoist \nreeving.  Permitting the use of fiber core ropes for boom hoist reeving on  cranes, as the commenter suggests, \nwould reduce protection over that  currently considered prudent in the industry, and OSHA is therefo re  \npromulgating paragraph (b)(1) as proposed, renumbering it as paragraph  (d)(1).     Proposed paragraph \n(b)(2) prohibited the use of rotation resistant  rope for boom hoist reeving except where the requirements of \nparagraph  (c) (renumbered paragraph (e) in the final rule), are met. No comments  were received on this \nparagraph (b)(2), and it is being promulgated as  paragraph (d)(2) with the reference to paragraph (c) in the \nproposed  rule changed to paragraph (e)  Paragraph (e) Rotation Resistant Ropes  Paragraph (e)(1)      \nProposed paragraph (c)(1) of this section classified rotation  resistant ropes into three \"Types\" (\"Type I\", \"Type \nII\", and  \"Type III\"). Proposed paragraph (c)(2) specified use limitations and  requirements for each type of \nwire rope. This approach differed from  former subpart N, ANSI B30.5-1968 and ASME B30.5-2004, which did \nnot  distinguish between types of rotation resistant rope. By distinguishing  between different types of rope, \nthe Committee sought to ensure that  ropes with different internal structures were subject to appropriate  \nrequirements and limitations that would enable them to be used safely.  Types I, II, and III, which have different \ncapabilities, were described  in proposed paragraph (c)(1).      ASTM A 1023/A 1023M -02 has a similar \nclassification system,  although it divides rotation resistant ropes into \"categories\" rather  than \"types.\" One \ncommenter noted that there is no meaningful  difference between the classification in the proposed rule and \nthat in  ASTM A 1023. (ID -0060.1.) This commenter urged OSHA to incorporate by reference  the ASTM \ndefinitions rather than to state the definitions in the final rule.  This would, the commenter suggested, avoid \nconfusion among manufacturers  and users who rely on the ASTM's classification system.     Although the \nprovisions in the final rule are substantively similar  to those in the ASTM standard, the Agency uses the term \n\"category\" in  the wire rope provisions of subpart CC that relate to the  classification of apparent deficiencies \n(see, e.g., Sec.   1926.1413(a)(2)). Therefore, to avoid confusion with those provision,  OSHA uses the term \n\"type\" in classifying rotation resistant rope in  Sec.  1926.1414. OSHA concludes that the use of \"category\" \nin the  ASTM standard would cause considerable confusion if OSHA were to  incorporate the ASTM \ndefinitions directly. Accordingly, OSHA is  promulgating proposed paragraph (c)(1) as paragraph (e)(1) of the \nfinal  rule. Paragraph (e)(2)     Paragraphs (e)(2) of this section sets forth use requirements of  the three \ntypes of rotation resistant rope in terms of operating design  factors (and in some instances activity). The \npurpose of these  provisions is to ensure that the selection of the type of rotation  resistant rope is suitable, \nin terms of safety, to its use.      These requirements are identical to those in proposed paragrap h  (c)(2).",

The first group argued that some \ncontrolling entities are either  not engaged in construction work, \\12\\ may have little to no expertise  \nconcerning ground conditions in general, or may hire subcontractors to  work at a remote location of which \nthe controlling entity may have  little knowledge. (See, e.g., ID-147.1; -0165.1; -0232.1; -0235.1.)  This group \nappears to read Sec.  1926.1402(c)(1) to mean that the  controlling entity must personally determine and \nprovide the ground  conditions necessary to meet the requirements in Sec.  1926.1402(b).  ----------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------      \\12\\ In most cases entity that meets the definition of  \n\"controlling entity\" will be engaged in construction.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \nC-DAC considered the concern that some controlling entities would  not have the expertise needed to \ndetermine if ground conditions were  adequate. The final rule therefore addresses this concern in two ways.  \nFirst, paragraph (c)(1) provides that the controlling contractor is  responsible for \"ensuring\" that these ground \nconditions are provided.  In other words, if the controlling contractor is not familiar with the  crane's \nrequirements or with the ground conditions at the particular  site, then it must make sure that someone who \nis familiar with those  requirements and conditions provides what is required by Sec.   1926.1402(b). Second, \nunder Sec.  1926.1402(e), if the A/D director or  operator determines that ground conditions are inadequate, \nthe  controlling entity will, through a discussion, obtain the relevant  information. (See discussion of \n1926.1402(e) at 73 FR 59741, Oct. 9, 2008).      One of the commenters suggested that Sec.  1926.1402(c) \nbe revised  to place requirements on either the controlling entity or a competent  person designated by the \ncontrolling entity. (ID-0191.1.) As explained  above, Sec.  1926.1402, as promulgated, does not preclude a \ncontrolling  entity from using a competent person to provide the information it  needs to meet its \nresponsibilities under this section. However, C-DAC's  experience indicates that it is important to ensure that \none entity  with the authority to address ground condition hazards has the  responsibility to do so. To permit \na controlling entity to divest  itself of its ground condition responsibilities would unduly fragment  \nresponsibility for ground conditions, thus defeating one of the goals  of the section.     The second group \nargued that the rule may result in situations that  are beyond the capacity and responsibility of certain \nsubcontractors.  (See, e.g., ID -0165.1; -0191.1; -0235.1.) One commenter suggested that  the definition of \n\"controlling entity\" be revised \"to reflect that  subcontractors and others who have little to do with the overall  \nproject including site conditions and do not have the expertise to  determine compliance with crane \nmanufacturer specifications are not  included in the definition, purpose, or requirements of a controlling  \nentity.\" (ID-0191.1) These commenters also argued that, because such  subcontractors do not know or control \nthe site conditions, the  responsibilities in Sec.  1926.1402(c) should fall on the crane owner  or operator. \nThe other two commenters were concerned about the effect  of the rule on heating, ventilating, air \nconditioning, and  refrigeration (HVACR) contractors in particular. (ID -0165.1; -0235.1.)     These \ncommenters have misunderstood Sec.  1926.1402(c). For  example, an HVACR contractor, if contracted to do \nonly HVACR work and  is not in control of the entire work site, would not be the controlling  entity, and would \nbe subject to the limited requirements in Sec.   1926.1402(d) only if it had authority to make changes to the \nground  conditions.     One commenter requested that the term \"user of the equipment\" be  defined.",

(ID -0161.1.) This commenter  misunderstands the \nprovision. Paragraph (b)(4)(v) allows employers to  use an insulating link between the load line and load as an \nalternative  to other protective measures. It has nothing to do with live line  procedures under Sec.  \n1910.269, which is a general industry standard  that applies to operation and maintenance of power lines and \nwhich has  no provision regulating the proximity of an operator or a qualified  person to an insulating link.     \nOne commenter pointed out that insulating links do not provide  protection for those em ployees, such as \nequipment operators, who are in  contact with the equipment \"upstream\" of the insulating link. (ID- 0053.1.) \nThat is incorrect. Insulating links serve a dual purpose. They  protect a rigger who is handling the load if the \nequipment upstream of  the link makes electrical contact with a power line. And they protect  employees \nwho are upstream of the insulating link if the load makes  electrical contact with a power line. The workers \nwho are at the  greatest risk of electrocution--the riggers who handle the load, are  also protected by the \nrequirement for nonconductive tag lines. But the  best protection for all workers, and the primary focus of \nparagraph  (b), is to employ effective encroachment prevention measures to prevent  electrical contact of \nany part of the equipment and/or load with a  power line. For additional discussion of insulating links, see \nlater in  this preamble where OSHA addresses Sec.  1926.1410(d)(4).  Paragraph (b)(5)     Employers \nengaged in construction of electric transmission and  distribution lines, which is addressed by 29 CFR part \n1926 subpart V  (Sec. Sec.  1926.950 -1926.960), also have to meet the requirements in  Sec.  1926.1408, \nwith several exceptions.\\51\\ The first exception is  found in Sec.  1926.1408(b)(5). The other exceptions are \ndiscussed  elsewhere in this preamble. In accordance with Sec.  1926.1408(b)(5),  employers engaged in \nwork involving cranes/derricks that is covered by  subpart V are not required to comply with the requirements \nin Sec.   1926.1408(b)(4). Subpart V applies to the construction of electric  transmission and distribution \nlines and equipment, which includes the  alteration, conversion, and improvement of existing lines and  \nequipment. Thus, when employees are engaged in subpart V work near  energized lines, by the nature of the \njob, their full attention is on  the power lines. Non-subpart V workers, by contrast, do not work  directly with \nthe lines, and their attention is primarily directed  elsewhere. --------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------      \\51\\ As discussed in Sec.  1926.1400, Scope, construction of  electric transmission and \ndistribution lines is covered under this  subpart. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \nSubpart V contains additional requirements to protect those  employees against making electrical contact \nwith the lines. These  include requirements in Sec.  1926.950(c) for guarding the lin e or  using insulation \n(such as insulating gloves) to prevent electrical  contact. This paragraph is promulgated as proposed.  \nParagraph (c) Voltage Information     This section operates in conjunction with Sec.   1926.1408(a)(2)(iii) \n(Option (3)--Table A clearance). Where an employer  elects to use Option (3) (Sec.  1926.1408(a)(2)(iii)), the \nemployer  must, under Sec.  1926.1408(a)(2)(iii)(A), determine the volt age of the  power lines. Under Sec.  \n1926.1408(c), utility owner/operators of these  lines must provide the requested voltage information within \ntwo working  days of the request (see the discussion above of Sec.  1926.1407(e) for  a description of the \npublic comments received on this requirement and  OSHA's resolution of the issues raised by those \ncomments).     As discussed above with respect to Sec.",

After \nconsidering various possible approaches,  including those in industry consensus standards, the Commit tee \ndecided  that it would be very difficult, and likely unnecessary, to identify  minimum physical requirements \nthat would be appropriate.      First, the physical demands of equipment covered by this rule vary  \nsignificantly depending on the type and, in some cases, age of the equipment.  For example, some equipment \nis operated largely by electronic controls. In  contrast, older \"friction cranes\" have pedal controls that can \nrequire significant  strength and stamina to operate. Some equipment is air condit ioned whereas  other \nequipment is not. Tower cranes can require very long climbs to the  operator station; small mobile hydraulic \ncranes typically have an  operator's station that is much more easily accessible. A requirement  regarding \nphysical qualifications would have to account for these types  of differences.     Second, establishing \nphysical qualifications that would  appropriately account for the effect of medical conditions would be a  \ncomplex undertaking. The Committee ultimately determined that, i n light  of its members' experience that \naccidents caused by problems associated  with the operator's physical/medical condition are rare, the issue \nof  physical qualifications did not need to be addressed by this standard.     Several commenters suggested \nthat OSHA should require operators to  undergo and pass medical examinations. (ID-0104.1; -0143.1; -0151.1; \n- 0152.1; -0187.1.) A trade association suggested that medical testing of  vision, hearing, and potential for \nseizures, epilepsy, emotional  instability, high blood pressure, and other physical impairments should  be part \nof requirements for safe crane opera tion. (ID-0187.1.) A safety  consultant stated that establishing physical \nqualifications that would  appropriately account for the effects of medical conditions would not  be a \ncomplex undertaking. (ID -0152.1.) This commenter suggested that a  doctor who p erforms an operator's \nphysical and medical examination  could determine if an operator was medically qualified to operate a  crane.     \nOSHA is not persuaded by these comments. First, OSHA concludes that  it would not be reasonable to rely on \nthe unguided discretion of  examining physicians to determine whether an operator is medically  qualified \nto operate a crane. Doing so would likely lead to a wide  variation in the medical conditions that different \nphysicians believe  are either necessary or unnecessary for crane operation. Moreover,  individual physicians \nare unlikely to be aware of the variety of  conditions that may influence an individual's ability to operate a  \ncrane safely, such as the variation in strength needed to operate the  controls on different types of cranes. \nAlthough physicians are able to  determine if an individual has a particular medical condition, they are  not \nwell situated to determine if that condition should preclude the  individual from operating a crane.     OSHA \nalso finds the comment by the trade association to be  unpersuasive. First, this commenter nominated a C -\nDAC member, who did  not dissent on this issue. The commenter did not explain why it is  deviating from the \nposition its nominee took on C -DAC, and for that  reason OSHA gives reduced weight to its comment. \nMoreover, OSHA notes  that some of the criteria suggested by the commenter, particularly the  phrase \n\"other physical impairments,\" are of questionable value in  determining the physical qualifications of crane \noperators. Indeed,  OSHA determines that the commenter's inclusion of such a catchall  phrase highlights \nthe difficulty of trying to list th e medical  conditions that should preclude a person from operating a crane.      \nIn short, OSHA has not been given any persuasive reason to deviate  from the considered judgment of C-DAC \nthat this standard should not  address the issue of physical qualifications of equipment operators. Substance \nAbuse Testing     As explained in the proposed rule, C -DAC considered whether to  include mandatory \nsubstance abuse testing for equipment operators and  others, such as signal persons, whose jobs affect safety. \nIt decided  against doing so because of the procedural limitations such a  requirement would impose on",

This qualification would be portable, that is, any employer could  rely on such \ndocumentation to show that a signal person meets the  criteria. C-DAC determined that such portability would \nbe appropriate  because of the independence and expertise of the third-party evaluator.     Under Option \n(2) of this section (Sec.  1926.1428(a)(2)), an  employer's own qualified evaluator (not a third party) would \ndetermine  that a signal person meets the qualification requirements. Since such a  determination would not \nbe done by an independent entity, other  employers would not have a basis to assume tha t the assessment \nhad been  done correctly. Therefore, a qualification under this option would not  be portable; other \nemployers would not be permitted to rely upon it to  show that the signal person meets these requirements.     \nOne commenter argued for th e deletion of Option (2) of this section  (the employer option) altogether to \nensure that an independent  evaluator trains signalpersons according to the established best  practices of \nthe industry. (ID-0156.1.) The commenter did not explain  why employer evaluations were less effective. To \nthe contrary, the  Agency notes that C-DAC experience indicated that employer evaluations  of signal persons \nwere effective. The employer evaluation may in some  cases be even more effective and efficient than \nindependent  evaluations, such as for the evaluation of employer specific signals.  Sections 1926.1428(a)(1) \nand (2) (Options (1) and (2)) are promulgated  as proposed.     The term \"qualified evaluator\" used in \nproposed Sec.   1926.1428(a)(2) was defined in proposed Sec.  1926.1401 as \"a person  employed by the \nsignal person's employer who has demonstrated that he/  she is competent in accurately assessing whether \nindividuals meet the  Qualification Requirements in this subpart for a signal person.\" In  reviewing the C-DAC \ndocument, the Agency realized that the Committee  had not provided a definition for the term \"third party \nqualified  evaluator,\" which was used in proposed Sec.  1926.1428(a)(1). OSHA  therefore added to the \nproposed rule a definition for this term.      The Agency requested public comment about whether this \ndefinition  is appropriate, and two commenters indicated support for the  definition. (ID-0187.1; -0205.1.) \nOne commenter requested that, in the  phrase, \"due to its independence and expertise,\" the Agency add  \n\"history in providing training\" as an additional criterion and  include labor-management joint apprenticeship \ntraining programs as an  example of an entity that meets this definition. (ID -0191.1; -0194.1.)     The role \nof the third-party qualified evaluator in Sec.   1926.1428(a)(2) is to assess the individual's competence. The \nexpertise  needed for training is not the same as the expertise needed for  evaluating competence (see the \nexplanation of the distinction between  training expertise and competence evaluation in the discussion of Sec.   \n1926.1427). Therefore, it would be inappropriate to require training  expertise as a prerequisite for being \nconsidered a third-party  qualified evaluator.\\122\\ Similarly, while labor-management joint  apprenticeship \ntraining programs that train and assess signal persons  would typically meet the definition for a third -party \nqualified  evaluator, OSHA concludes that including them as an example in the  definition could incorrectly \nimply that training expertise (as opposed  to assessment expertise) is a prerequisite. --------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------      \\122\\ A third party evaluator that did not have signal person  training \nexpertise would nonetheless have to have substantive  expertise in signaling and the other subjects referred \nto in Sec.   1926.1428, as well as expertise in assessment, to meet the  \"expertise\" criterion in the definition. \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------      Several other commenters expressed general \nsupport for the  definition of a third -party qualified evaluator but requested  clarifications. Two of these \ncommenters proposed changing the  definition to specify that an \"individual\" could also qualify as a  third-\nparty qualified evaluator. (ID -0205.1; -0222.1.) This is   unnecessary because the word \"entity\" already",

Thus, OSHA may \ninclude information-gathering  requirements among the provisions of a standard. Section 1926.1407(e)  falls \nwithin the scope of sec. 6(b)(7), because voltage information is  necessary to the determination of safe \nclearance distances for  employees who work near power lines.      The Agency previously exercised its \nauthority under sec. 6(b)(7) of  the Act to promulgate the Hazard Communication Standard, which requires  \nthat chemical manufacturers and importers provide information for the  benefit of downstream employees \n(see Sec.  1910.1200). As a rationale  for these provisions, OSHA explained that chemical manufacturers and  \nimporters are in the best position to develop, disseminate, or obtain  information about their products (see \n48 FR 53280, 53322, Nov. 25,  1983). Similarly, in an early case discussing sec. 6(b)(7), the Fifth  Circuit found \nthat \"[t]he ability of downstream employers to protect  their own employees is also an appropriate \nconsideration in determining  where the duty to warn should lie.\" American Petroleum Institute v.  OSHA, \n581 F.2d 493, 509 (5th Cir. 1978).     Section 8(g)(2) of the Act affords the Secretary additional  authority \nfor Sec.  1926.1407(e). According to this sec tion, the  Secretary may \"prescribe such rules and regulations as \nhe may deem  necessary to carry out responsibilities under the Act.\" The enumerated  purposes of the Act \nindicate that the Secretary's responsibilities  include:      -- Setting mandatory oc cupational safety and \nhealth standards  applicable to businesses affecting interstate commerce (29 U.S.C.  651(b)(3));     --\nDeveloping innovative methods, techniques, and approaches for  dealing with occupational safety and health \nproblems (29 U.S.C.  651(b)(5)); and     --Providing for appropriate reporting procedures with respect to  \noccupational safety and health which procedures will help achieve the  objectives of this Act and accurately \ndescribe the nature of the  occupational safety and health problem (29 U.S.C. 651(b)(12)).      An electric \nutility representative asserted that, because employees  of electric utilities are not likely to perform work \nunder the  circumstances that the standard contemplates, sec. 4(a) prevents OSHA  from including \nrequirements that target electric utilities. OSHA  disagrees. Section 4(a) broadly provides that the OSH Act \napplies  \"with respect to employment performed in a workplace,\" 29 U.S.C.  653(a), and does not bar the \nstatute's application to any class of  employers. Section 4(a) contains no language to suggest that the Act's  \napplication depends on the relationship between the employees at risk  and the employer with the power to \nreduce the ir risk.      Additionally, the commenter stated that Sec.  1910.12(a) precludes  OSHA from \nregulating electric utilities, because employees of electric  utilities will not be present at construction \nworksites and therefore  will not be \"engaged in construction.\" \\40\\ The commenter cites Reich  v. Simpson, \nGumpertz & Heger, Inc., 3 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1993), in  which the First Circuit relied on the second sentence \nof Sec.   1910.12(a) as a basis for vacating citations that OSHA had issued to an  engineering firm under the \nmulti-employer worksite doctrine.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\40\\ It \nshould be noted that utility employees will be at these  worksites from time to time to perform work on the \npower lines. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      Simpson, Gumpertz is inapposite; \nthe multi-employer worksite  doctrine has no bearing on the validity of Sec.  1926.1407(e), which  explicitly \nholds electric utilities responsible for the distribution of  voltage information. A more relevant case is Sec'y of \nLabor v. Trinity  Indus., Inc., 504 F.3d 397 (3d Cir. 2007), in which the Third Circuit  upheld information \ndisclosure requirements that are analogous to those  in Se c.  1926.1407(e).",

Section 1926.1410(d) \nsets out the minimum protective measures that  must be included in the procedures set by the employer and \nutility  owner/operator (or registered professional engineer). These procedures  need to include more \nstringent protective measures than those set out  in Sec.  1926.1408, because equipment will be in closer \nproximity to  power lines and ther e is otherwise a greater risk of contacting a power  line and causing \nelectrocution. Therefore, these procedures have to  include, at a minimum, those set out in the remainder of \nthis section.      Commenters objected to having the utility owner/operator in volved  in the planning \nmeeting required by paragraph (d) of this section. (ID- 0161.1; -0162.1.) As with paragraph (c) of this section, \ndiscussed  above, the utility owner/operator is not required to become involved  with the decisions that \nmust be made under this section. If the utility  owner/operator declines to participate in the planning meeting, \nthe  employer must engage a registered professional engineer to help  determine the procedures needed to \nprevent electrical contact. OSHA  notes, however, that equipment making electrical contact with a power  \nline can disrupt electrical service as well as create a hazard to  employees on the worksite. Therefore, at least \nin some cases, the  utility owner/operator may wish to help develop precautions to prevent  such electrical \ncontact. Paragraph (d)(1)     Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, for power lines that are  equipped with \na device that automatically reenergizes the circuit in  the event of a power line contact, the automatic \nreclosing feature of  the circuit interrupting device must be made inoperative prior to  beginning work. This \nwill help ensure that, in the event of a power  line contact and activation of the automatic reclosing feature, \nthe  line would not be automatically re -energized. One commenter stated that  many circuit interrupting \ndevices currently in use are incapable of  having their automatic reclosing mechanisms disabled. (ID-0155.1.) \nOSHA  verified that fact and has amended Sec.  1926.1410(d)(1) to clarify  that the automatic reclosing \nfeature must be made inoperative only if  the design of the device permits.\\59\\ --------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------      \\59\\ This revised la nguage is also consistent with the  provisions of Sec.  \n1910.269(q)(3)(iv). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  Paragraph (d)(2)      Under \nparagraph (d)(2) of this section, a dedicated spotter who is  in continuous contact with the operator must be \nused. In addition, the  dedicated spotter must be equipped with a visual aid to assist in  identifying the \nminimum clearance distance, must be positioned to  effectively gauge the clearance distance, where \nnecessary must u se  equipment that enables him or her to communicate directly with the  operator, and \nmust give timely information to the operator so the  required clearance distance can be maintained. For a \nmore in-depth  analysis of the dedicated spotter requirement and the public comments  received, consult \nthe discussion of Sec. Sec.  1926.1407(b)(3)(i) and  1926.1408(b)(4)(ii) above. This provision is promulgated \nas proposed.  Paragraph (d)(3)     Under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, an elevated warning line,  or \nbarricade that is not attached to the equipment, positioned to  prevent electrical contact, must be used. This \nwarning line or  barricade must be in view of the operator either directly or by use of  video equipment and \nmust be equipped with flags or similar high - visibility markings. The need for an elevated warning line or \nbarricade  is explained above in the discussion of Sec.  1926.1408(b)( 3). This  provision does not apply to \nsubpart V work.

These t wo paragraphs of Sec.  1926.753 reference  Sec.  1926.1431(a) because the \nrequirement formerly found in Sec.   1926.550(g)(2) is now contained in Sec.  1926.1431(a) of subpart CC.   \nSubpart S --Underground Construction, Caissons, Cofferdams, and  Compressed Air  Amendments to Sec.  \n1926.800     This section regulates hoisting unique to underground construction.  Prior to the promulgation \nof this final rule, Sec.  1926.800(t) of this  section referenced former Sec.  1926.550(g), which has been  \nredesignated Sec.  1926.1501(g). The Agency intended that the reference  to former Sec.  1926.550(g) be \nreplaced by a reference to new subpart  CC, but inadvertently omitted that action from the Federal Register  \nnotice for the proposed rule. To avoid any potential notice issues that  might arise if the Agency substituted a \nreference to subpart CC in  place of the prior reference to former Sec.  1926.550(g), the Agency  has instead \nelected to redesignate Sec.  1926.550 as Sec.  1926.1501 in  new subpart DD, which has been  created for \nthis purpose. The Agency  intends to revisit this issue in the near future.      References to former Sec.  \n1926.550(g) have been replaced with  references to Sec.  1926.1501(g). This redesignation of Sec.  \n1926.550  and the replacement of references do not alter any of the substantive  requirements of Sec.  \n1926.800(t), do not change any existing rights or  obligations, and no member of the regulated community is \nlikely to  object to it.

The Agency intended  for the reference to subpart N in Sec.  1926.856(c) to be supplemented  \nwith a reference to new subpart CC, and intended that the reference to  subpart N in Sec.  1926.858(b) be \nreplaced by a reference to new  subpart CC, but inadvertently omitted that action from the Federal  Register \nnotice for the proposed rule. To avoid any potential notice  issues that might arise if the Agency substituted a \nreference to new  subpart CC in place of the prior reference to subpart N, the Agency has  instead elected to \nredesignate Sec.  1 926.550 as Sec.  1926.1501 in  a new subpart DD which has been created for this purpose. \nThe Agency  intends to revisit this issue in the near future.      References to subpart N in Sec. Sec.  \n1926.856(c) and 1926.858(b)  have been supplemented or replaced with references to Sec.  1926.1501.  \nThis redesignation of Sec.  1926.550 and the replacement of references  do not alter any of the substantive \nrequirements of Sec. Sec.   1926.856(c) and 1926.858(b), do not change any existing rights or  obligations, \nand no member of the regulated community is likely to  object to it. OSHA, therefore, finds good cause that \nthe opportunity  for public comment is unnecessary within the meaning of 5 U.S.C.  553(b)(3)(B), 29 U.S.C.",
    "c6b933ee-2208-42bf-b644-5ade76d15976": "page_label: 139\nfile_name: OSHA-Final Rule-Cleaned.pdf\nfile_path: C:\\Users\\bs44876\\Desktop\\Project\\CII-Crane\\FineEmb\\dataset\\data\\OSHA-Final Rule-Cleaned.pdf\nfile_type: application/pdf\nfile_size: 3496317\ncreation_date: 2025-01-07\nlast_modified_date: 2025-01-07\n\nbelow, has been modified from the proposed  rule to require outrigger/stabilizer position sensor monitors \nrather  than outrigger position sensor monitors on equipment manufactured more  than one year after the \neffective date of the standard. As so modified,  the provision appropriately applies to articulating cranes.      \nAnother commenter stated that digger derricks do not typically have  anti-two blocking devices (paragraph \n(d)(3)), radius indicators  (paragraph (e)(1)), load weighing devices (paragraph (e)(4)), outrigger  position \nindicators (paragraph (e)(6)(i)), and hoist drum rotation  indicators (paragraph (e)(5)(ii).\\80\\ (ID-0155.1.) This \ncommenter does  not state that such devices would be impractical on digger derricks but  only that they are \nnot currently equipped with the devices. OSHA notes  that the ANSI standard applicable to digger derricks, \nANSI/ASSE A10.31- 2006, does not require the devices listed by the commenter. As noted  above, this final \nrule is exempting certain older or existing equipment  from the need to be equipped with certain operational \naids when the  consensus standard for such equipment has not required those devices.  Consistent with this \npolicy, OSHA is specifying that only those digger  derricks manufactured more than one year after the effective \ndate of  this standard must be equipped with anti -two blocking devices, boom  angle or radius indicators, \nand load weighing devices. Under Sec.   1926.1416(e)(5), outrigger position indicators and hoist drum \nrotation  indicators are not required on any equipment until one year after the  effective date of the standard, \nso it is not necessary to single out  digger derricks for special treatment for these devices. Accordingly,  OSHA \nis adding Sec.  1926.1416(a)(2) to the final rule, which provides  that the requirements in Sec. Sec.  \n1926.1416(d)(3), (e)(1), and (e)(4)  only apply to those digger derricks manufactured more than one year  \nafter the effective date of this standard.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\80\\ \nThe term \"digger derrick\" is defined in Sec.  1926.1401.  As discussed in Sec.  1926.1400, digger derricks \nare not covered by  the standard when used for work related to utility poles but are  subject to this final rule \nwhen used covered for general lifting  activities unrelated to utility poles.  --------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------  Paragraph (b)     Proposed paragraph (b) of this section stated that operations \nshall  not begin unless the listed operational aids are in proper working  order, except where the employer \nmeets specified temporary alternative  measures. If the crane or derrick manufacturer specified more  \nprotective alternative measures, the employer would have to follow  those measures.     Upon reviewing \nthe proposed paragraph, OSHA believes it does not  state its requirement as clearly as possible. As subsequent \nprovisions  of this section make clear, employers may only use temporary  alternative measures while listed \noperational aids are being repaired,  and then only for limited times. OSHA is rewording paragraph (b) in the  \nfinal rule to make these requirements clearer.     Two hearing participants requested that, in general, OSHA \nremove  any provision in the proposed rule that would require strict adherence  to manufacturer's \nprocedures. (ID-0341; -0342.) Compliance with  manufacturer procedures is addressed in the discussion of \nSec.   1926.1417. In addition, OSHA determines that the rule addresses the  hearing participants' concerns. \nEmployers can fully comply with the  standard by maintaining the listed operational aids i n proper working  \norder. For brief periods while such aids are being repaired, employers  can generally comply by following the \ntemporary alternatives listed in  the rule. Only if manufacturers recommend safer alternatives, which  OSHA \nconcludes will rarel y occur, will employers need to look to those  recommendations rather than the \nprecautions specified in the rule.  Paragraph (c)      Paragraph (c) of this section states that if a listed \noperational  aid stops working properly during operations, the operato r must safely  stop operations until \nthe temporary alternative measures are  implemented or the device is again working properly. Further, if a  \nreplacement part is no longer available, a substitute device that  performs the same type of function may be",

In the proposed rule, OSHA discussed how the  \nprovisions of this rule addressed two major problems employers faced in  complying with the minimum \nclearance requirements of former subpart N:  (1) The lack of a means to enable operators to judge when the \ncrane was  breaching the minimum required clearance distance; and (2) the problem  of temporary operator \ninattention to a power line as he/she  concentrated on tasks related to moving the load. (73 FR 59749, Oct. 9,  \n2008.) The provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, discussed  below, are designed to overcome these two \nproblems and ensure  compliance with the minimum clearance distances in this rule. Even  where Table A \npermits the clearance distance to be the same as the 10- foot rule of former subpart N, this final rule provides \nfar greater  protection against equipment violating the allowed clearance. It does  not allow a crane \"to very \neasily encroach\" on a safe clearance  distance, as IBEW suggests.     The labor representative also proposed \nmore stringent requirements  than those currently contained in Sec.  1926.1410 when it is infeasible  to \nmaintain the Table A clearances. OSHA addresses this issue below in  the discussion of Sec.  1926.1410. \nAccordingly, paragraph (a)(2)(iii)  is promulgated as proposed.  Paragraph (b) Preventing \nEncroachment/Electrocution     Once the employer has determined that some part of the crane, load  or \nload line could come within th e work zone assessment trigger  distance of 20 feet of a power line (see Sec.  \n1926.1408(a)), if it  chooses either Option (2) or (3) (of Sec.  1926.1408(a)(2)(ii) and  (iii)), it must \nimplement encroachment prevention measures to help  ensure that the app licable minimum clearance \ndistance (20 feet under  Option (2) or the Table A distance) under Option (3) is not  breached.\\47\\ Most of \nthe measures in this paragraph are designed to  help the employer maintain the appropriate distance and \nthereby prevent  electrical contact while operating the equipment. One of the measures  is designed to \nprevent electrocution in the event of electrical  contact. ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n------      \\47\\ Alternatively, under Option (1) of Sec.  1926.1408(a)(i),  the employer could have the lines \ndeenergized and grounded. If  Option (1) were selected, no further action under this section would  be \nrequired. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  Paragraph (b)(1)      Under \n1926.1408(b)(1) the employer is required to conduct a  planning meeting with the operator and other workers \nwho will be in the  area of the crane or load. This planning meeting must include reviewing  the location of \nthe power line(s) and the steps that will be  implemented to prevent encroachment and electrocution.      \nOne commenter raised the issue of who is responsible for ensuring  that the planning meeting takes place. \n(ID-0218.1.) Where encroachme nt  precautions are required under Option (2) or Option (3) (see Sec.   \n1926.1408(a)(2)(ii) and Sec.  1926.1408(a)(2)(iii)), the employers of  the operator and other workers who will \nbe in the area of the equipment  or load must ensure that the required pl anning meeting under Sec.   \n1926.1408(b)(1) takes place. Other employers at the work site may also  be responsible for such compliance \nin certain situations; see OSHA CPL  02-00-124, Multi -Employer Citation Policy, Dec. 10, 1999 for further  \ninformation.     As discussed below, under this paragraph, certain encroachment/ electrocution prevention \nmeasures are required (they are listed in  Sec.  1926.1408(b)(1) through (3)). In addition, the employer is  \nrequired to select at least one additional measure from  the list in  Sec.  1926.1408(b)(4). In the planning \nmeeting, the employer must make  that selection and review all the measures that will be used to comply  \nwith this section.",

Therefore, OSHA has modified Sec.  1926.1426(a)(1)(iii) \nto prohibit  free fall (live boom) where the power line or the Table A clearance  distance is within the fall path \nof the boom or the load.     Paragraph (a)(1)(iv) prohibits use of a live boom where the load is  over a shaft. \nEmployees in a shaft receiving a load are at high risk of  death or injury from a free falling boom as the shaft \nseverely limits  the ability to avoid the falling boom. Because this hazard only exists  when there is an \nemployee in the shaft, OSHA has specified in Sec.   1926.1426(a)(1)(iv) of the final rule that t he live boom \nprohibition  only applies when at least one employee is in the shaft. This language  is different from the \nlanguage of Sec.  1926.1426(a)(1)(v), regarding  cofferdams, because a shaft is typically a smaller work space \nthan a  cofferdam, thus, a shaft under a load is necessarily in the fall zone  of the boom or the load.      \nParagraph (a)(1)(v) prohibits free fall of a boom when the load is  over a cofferdam, except where there are",

One commenter suggested that the final rule require a \"lift  director\" for \neach multiple-crane/derrick lift and that the \"lift  director must be present for each critical lift.\" (ID -0178.1.) \nOSHA  agrees and, to also be consistent with the identification of the A/D  director in Sec.  1926.1404(a), \nhas denoted the person directing the  multiple-crane/derrick lift as the \"lift director.\"  Paragraph (b)(2)      \nOSHA has decided to replace the term \"supervisor\" in Sec.   1926.1432(b)(2) with the term \"lift director.\" This \ndecision was made  to be consistent with the similar change from \"A/D supervisor\" to  \"A/D director\" in Sec.  \n1926.1404(a) an d the change from \"lift  supervisor\" to \"lift director\" in Sec. Sec.  1926.1419(c)(2),  \n1926.1421(a), and 1926.1421(c). (For a detailed explanation of this  change, refer to the preamble discussion \nof Sec.  1926.1404(a),  Supervision--competent-qualified person).     Section 1926.1432(b)(2) mandates \nthat the director review the plan  with all employees who will be involved with the operation before lift  \noperations begin. The Committee determined that it is important for  employees to know how the plan will \nwork, including their  responsibilities and the responsibilities of others, to help ensure  that the diverse \naspects of the operation will be coordinated (see the  more complete discussion of this provision in the \nproposed rule  preamble at 73 FR 59841, Oct. 9, 2008).     One commenter suggested adding an additional \nprovision to proposed  Sec.  1926.1432(b) to enable the person directing the lift, or the  operator, to halt \noperations if at any time the lift director  determined the lift could not be safely executed pursuant to the lift  \nplan. (ID-0182.1; -0357.1.) If such a halt to operations occurred, the  suggested provision would require the \nlift director to modify the lift  plan and review any such modifications with al l workers involved with  the \noperation. (ID-0182.1.)     Adding such a provision is unnecessary because Sec.  1926.1432 and  other \nprovisions in subpart CC already incorporate the commenter's  suggestions. As discussed above, Sec.  \n1926.1432(b) requires th e lift  director to be a competent person. As defined in Sec.  1926.1401, a  \ncompetent person \"is a person who is capable of identifying * * *  hazards * * * and who has authorization to \ntake prompt corrective  measures to eliminate them.\" This ensures that the lift director has  the authority to \nboth halt operations and modify the plan if he or she  determined the lift could not be executed safely \naccording to the lift  plan. Also, under Sec.  1926.1418, the equipment operator has the  authority to stop \noperations whenever there is a concern as to safety.  Thus, both the lift director and equipment operator have \nthe authority  to halt a multiple -crane/derrick lift if either determines the lift  cannot be executed safely \npursuant to the lift plan.      Furthermore, if the lift director modified the plan, a review of  the modified \nplan with the workers is required under Sec.   1926.1432(b)(2) because it is a different plan from the one that \nhad  been used initially.     OSHA also received a comment suggesting that the plan-review  requirement \nin proposed Sec.  1926.1432(b)(2) did not make clear the  intention that the review take place in a meeting \nso that the plan  could be reviewed collectively with the workers as a group. (ID- 0182.1.) Because a collective \nreview is more likely to be effective  than separate, individual reviews, OSHA agrees with the commenter's  \nclarification and has inserted the phrase \"in a meeting\" into final  Sec.  1926.1432(b)(2).",

Personnel  platforms suspended by cranes or \nderricks are now regulated by Sec.   1926.1431. This change does not affect the requiremen ts of Sec.   \n1926.450(a), does not change any existing rights or obligations, and no  member of the regulated community \nis likely to object to it. OSHA,  therefore, finds good cause that the opportunity for public comment is  \nunnecessary within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), 29 U.S.C.  655(b), and 29 CFR 1911.5.  Subpart M--\nFall Protection   Amendments to Sec.  1926.500      Prior to the promulgation of this final rule, Sec.   \n1926.500(a)(2)(ii) stated that subpart N set forth the workplaces,  conditions, operations, and circumstances \nfor which fall protection  must be provided for employees working on \"certain cranes and  derricks.\" Because \nsubpart CC now provides comprehensive requirements  for the provision of fall protection to workers on \nequipment covered by  subpart CC, the Agency amended Sec.  1926.500(a)(2)(ii) by replacing  the reference \nto subpart N with a referenc e to subpart CC and deleting  the word \"certain.\"     Section 1926.500(a)(3) \nprovided that the requirements for the  installation, construction, and proper use of fall protection for  \nconstruction workers were set forth in Sec.  1926.502 of subpart M,  with certain exceptions. OSHA amended \nSec.  1926.500(a)(3) to provide  an exception for steps, handholds, ladders, and grabrails/guardrails/ railings \nrequired by subpart CC because the criteria for those forms of  fall protection are provided in subpart CC.

Furthermore, cranes used in residential  construction not only hoist \nloads to structures, but also hold loads in  position during installation activities, often with significant boom  \nextension. A rep resentative from a major crane -rental company shared  similar concerns during the public \nhearing about the hazards of boom  trucks used to perform relatively light lifts in support of  residential-\nconstruction activities. (ID-0344.) This witness stated  that boom-truck cranes present greater risk of tip over \nthan larger  cranes with wider outrigger bases and greater stability, and that an  inexperienced operator with \na rented crane (i.e., bare rental) may not  have this knowledge. This witness believed that  the operators of \nbare  rental cranes do not completely understand how much the capacity of the  equipment decreases as \nthe boom extends further. The witness described  crane incidents in which operators of small cranes tipped \nequipment or  dropped bundles  of roofing materials at residential -construction sites,  and provided \nnumerous photographs of crane failures at these sites.  (ID-0345.7.)     Two commenters stated that they \nbelieve the 2,000-pound limit is  appropriate. (ID-0205.1; -0213.1.) Discussion at the hearing also  addressed \nthe appropriateness of the 2,000 pound capacity limitation.  For example, a representative of a major local \ngovernment testified  about the city's experiences with smaller cranes, and explained that  smaller cranes, \nlike some knuckle-boom cranes, lift heavier loads and  extend their booms further than older cranes, allowing \nmaterials- delivery personnel at construction sites to position and hold materials  for contractors during \ninstallation and erection activities. (ID -0342.)  The city representative stated that, when employers perform \nthese  activities with greater capacity equipment, employers typically plan  for those operations; however, \nthe same planning is not necessarily  done by employers when using smaller capacity equipment for the same  \nactivities (i.e., lifting, moving, and landing materials).      After reviewing the comment s and testimony \nreceived on this issue,  OSHA finds no persuasive evidence that justifies revising the capacity  cut-off for the \napplication of the requirements Sec.  1926.1441. The  record provides no evidence that the hazards are \ndifferent for  equipment in the rated capacity range from 2,000 to 10,000 pounds than  the hazards \nassociated with equipment not covered by Sec.  1926.1441.  The myriad hazards addressed by this standard, \nincluding, for example,  inadequate ground conditions, power lines, ineffec tive signal communications,  \noverloading, and inadequate operator knowledge/ability, also are applicable  to equipment in this capacity \nrange. As noted in the discussion of  Sec.  1926.1427, some hazards may be increased because these cranes \nare  often used in tight spaces. Therefore, OSHA determines that the cut -off  point of 2,000 pounds or less \nas proposed is appropriate. This conclusion  is consistent with the judgment of the Committee as described in \nthe  proposal (73 FR 59869, Oct. 9, 2008).     Paragraph (a) of this section lists the provisions of this subpart  \nthat apply to equipment covered by this section. OSHA did not receive  any comments on proposed paragraph \n(a) and is deferring to the  Committee's determination that the hazards addressed by these  provisions apply \nirrespective of the equipment's rated capacity. For  example, the dangers associated with making electrical \ncontact with a  power line do not depend on the lifting capacity of the equipment, so  C-DAC determined \nthat Sec. Sec.  1926.1407 -1926.1411 on power line  safety should apply to all equipment regardless of rated \ncapacity.  Similarly, the other provisions listed in this paragraph apply to  equipment with a rated capacity of \n2,000 pounds or le ss to the same  extent that those sections apply to that type of equipment with a rated  \ncapacity in excess of 2,000 pounds. To avoid confusion, OSHA is  including references in this final paragraph \n(a) to provisions located  and required in other paragrap hs of proposed Sec.  1926.1441.  Therefore, \nparagraph (a) now also references Sec. Sec.",

As discussed in Section II of \nthis preamble,  OSHA finds that crane and derrick operations in construction constitute  a significant risk and \nestimates that the final standard will prevent  22 fatalities and 175 injuries annually. Section 6(b) of the OSH \nAct  requires OSHA to determine if its standards are technologically and  economically feasible. As discussed \nin Section V of this preamble, OSHA  finds that this final standard is economically and technologically  \nfeasible.     The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C 601, as amended) requires  that OSHA determine \nwhether a standard will have a significant economic  impact on a substantial number of small firms. As \ndiscussed in Section  V, OSHA examined the small firms affected by this standard and  certifies that the final \nstandard will not have a significant impact on  a substantial number of small firms.      Executive Order \n12866 requires that OSHA estimate the be nefits,  costs, and net benefits of its standards. The table below \nsummarizes  OSHA's findings with respect to the estimated costs, benefits, and net  benefits of this standard. \nAs is clear, the annual benefits are  significantly in excess of the annual costs.

The Committee did not want to restrict an  employer's ability to suspend an operator who tested \npositive pending  confirmation of the result.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \n\\121\\ See Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives' Ass'n, 489 U.S.  602 (1989); International Brotherhood of \nTeamsters v. Department of  Transportation, 932 F.2d 1292 (9th Cir. 1991). ---------------------------------------------\n------------------------------      In short, the Committee balanced the potential benefits from a  requirement \nfor substance abuse testing that would have more  restrictive procedures against the fact that many \nemployers already  have their own programs in place that, in C -DAC's view, may be more  protective than \nwhat could be enacted as an OSHA requirement. C -DAC  concluded that it would be better not to include a \nsubstance abuse  requirement.     Several commenters recommended that OSHA include substance abuse  \ntesting in the final rule. (ID-0104.1; -0105.1; -0151.1; -0152.1; - 0187.1.) These commenters did not, however, \naddress C-DAC's conclusion  that an OSHA mandate for such testing could have the adverse  consequence of \nlimiting employers' ability to enforce their own  substance abuse testing programs and could thereby detract \nfrom  worksite safety. OSHA therefore defers to C-DAC's judgment and declines  to include a substance abuse \ntesting requirement in the final rule. Section 1926.1428 Signal Person Qualifications     As discussed under \nSec.  1926.1419, Signals --general requirements,  the safety of equipment operations depends in many \nsituations on  signals given to the operator. It is critical that the operator  understand the signals given, and \nthe signal person must therefore be  able to give clear, accurate and appropriate signals that unambiguously  \nconvey the needed information. The Committee, which included a number  of members with significant \nexperience with signal persons, was  concerned that some signal persons are not ab le to recognize the  \nhazards involved with certain crane operations, do not, in some cases,  understand what it is that the crane \nneeds to do to accomplish the  task, and do not know how to give the appropriate signals. This poses  hazards, \nsuch as struck -by and crushed -by hazards, due to either  miscommunication or the communication of \ninstructions that are  inappropriate.     An example of the type of accident that can be caused by  \nmiscommunication from not knowing the appropriate signals is as  follows: The signal person intends to \nindicate to the operator to hoist  up, since the load needs to be raised straight up. However, the signal  \nperson uses the standard signal for booming up  in the mistaken belief  that this signal is for hoisting up. A \nstruck-by or crushed -by incident  could result because, when booming up, the load will move laterally as  \nwell as vertically.     A failure to understand what it is that the crane needs to do to  accomplish a task can \nalso lead to struck-by or crushed-by incidents.  For example, as a crane booms down, boom deflection tends \nto increase,  which has the effect of lowering the load more than if there were no  boom deflection. If the \nsignal person is unfamiliar with this boom  characteristic, he or she may fail to signal in time for the load to \nstop  at the correct point or may cause the load to descend too quickly.     The Committee concluded that \nto prevent such accidents it is  necessary to establish qualification criteria that would have to be met  for an \nindividual to serve as a signal person (that criteria is set out  in proposed Sec.  1926.1428(c), discussed \nbelow). The employer would  have the option of using one of two methods for ensuring that these  criteria \nwere met. Under Option (1) of this section (Sec.   1926.1428(a)(1)), the signal person would have \ndocumentation from an  independent \"qualified evaluator (third party),\" as defined in Sec.   1926.1401,",

Paragraph (f)(1) requires \nthat equipment covered by this section to  be equipped with an anti -two-block device when hoisting \npersonnel or  when hoisting over an occupied cofferdam or shaft. As discussed at  Sec.  1926.1416(d)(3), \ntwo-blocking can result in a sudden drop of the  load on the line. Anti-two-block devices protect against this \ndanger.  However, anti-two-blocking devices have a high rate of failure in a  marine environment due to wind \nand other environmental factors. Also,  the equipment covered by this section is often performing live boom/ \nfast-moving functions, causing an anti-two-block device to consistently  malfunction. Therefore, an anti-two-\nblock device is only required when  hoisting personnel or hoisting over an occupied cofferdam or shaft due  \nto the additional risk to employees during these operations.      Paragraph (f)(2) specifies that employers \nusing equipment to  perform dragline, clamshell (grapple), magnet, drop ball, container  handling, concrete \nbucket, and pile driving work covered by this  section, are exempt from the requirements of Sec.  \n1926.1416(e)(4),  Load weighing and similar devices. These operations add heavy loads and  repetitive \nmotion to the marine characteristics described above. As a  result, load weighing devices used during these \noperations consistently  malfunction. Additionally, the listing and tilting that is typical in  marine worksites \noften prevents these devices fr om providing accurate  load readings.     OSHA received no comments on \nthese provisions as proposed. However,  OSHA is retaining these provisions in the final rule because the  \nprovisions afford protection to workers involved in personnel lifting  operations or exposed to a load failure \nwhile working in cofferdams or  shafts. The provisions also prevent employers from relying on  \nmalfunctioning equipment to the detriment of employees using or exposed  to the equipment. Paragraph (g) \nAccessibility of Procedures Applicable to Equipment  Operation     Paragraph (g) of this section sets forth \nrequirements regarding  accessibility of equipment operation procedures. The provision requires  \nequipment with a cab to comply with the requirements of Sec.   1926.1417(c), Operation--accessibility of \nprocedures. If the equipment  does not have a cab then the requirements of this paragraph apply.     The \nAgency determined that it is necessary to have the load chart  located where the operator is stationed. Under \nSec.  1926.1437(g)(1),  if the operator's station is movable, such as with pendant -controlled  equipment, \nthe load chart must be posted on the equipment. Under Sec.   1926.1437(g)(2), the remaining procedures \n(other than load charts) must  be readily available on board the vessel/flotation device. Where there  is no \ncab for the equipment, it is impractical to require these other  procedures to be next to the operator; however, \nit is still necessary  for the operator to have easy access to these procedures for reference  during operations.     \nWhile OSHA received no comments on the proposed provisions, it is  retaining the provisions in the final rule \nbecause, as explained  elsewhere in this preamble, having this procedural information as  readily available \nas possible is critical to operating cranes/derricks  safely, thereby ensuring the protection of the workers \ninvolved in the  crane/derrick operations. Paragraph (h) Inspections     Paragraph (h) of this section sets \nforth additional inspection  requirements applicable to equipment covered by this section. The  introductory \nsentence to this paragraph states that Sec.  1926.1412,  Inspections, applies to the inspection of the \ncrane/derrick, and t hat  the additional inspection requirements in this paragraph apply to the  \nvessel/flotation device that supports the crane/derrick.      In the proposed rule, the Agency modified the \nlanguage of the C-DAC  consensus document for this introductory sentence by including coverage for floating \ncranes/derricks and requested comment on this  modification. Two commenters responded and both agreed \nwith the  modified language as used in the proposed rule. (ID -0205.1; -0213.1.)  OSHA is retaining this \nlanguage in the final rule because the increased  coverage enhances employee protection, and the",

Estimating the number of \ncranes and crane operators in affected general  industry sectors      Electric Power Generation (NAICS \n221110) and Electric  Power Transmission Control, and Distribution (NAICS 221120). The Agency  is basing its \nestimate of affected cranes and crane operators on the  industry profile and cost analysis for subpart V, Table \n5.1. (ID- 0389.2.) Table 5.1 shows that the two industries had about 114,500  employees working on power \nlines affected by subpart V in about 7,600  crews for Electric Power Generation and about 12,600 crews in the  \nTransmission, Control, and Distribution sector. Together, in total, the  Agency estimated that the industry was \nusing about 20,200 powered  vehicles, one for each crew. OSHA concludes that each sector has one  piece \nof equipment, such as a digger derrick, bucket truck, or truck - mounted crane that each crew works with (in \ncrew sizes of 3 or 6).  Further, based on several comments in the record that digger derricks  perform crane-\nrelated work in substations and other locations (ID - 0155.1; -0201.1; -0328.1; -0344), the Agency concl udes \nthat each digger  derrick would need a certified operator to work as the industry  customarily has. Other \ncomment in the record suggests that journeymen  are often hired as if each is completely trained in all aspects \nof work  (ID-0155.1; -0344); hence the industry has asserted that to maintain  this arrangement all linemen \nwould have to receive crane operator  certification, which would be prohibitively expensive (ID -0203.1; - \n0367.1). However, another comment in the record indicated that for each  crew, individuals have specific \nassignments--that not all journeymen  are given responsibility for operating lifting devices, whether that be  \na bucket truck or aerial lift, a crane, or a digger derrick. (ID -0344.)  Comment in the record indicates that, \nroughly, equipment is equally  divided between equipment that is covered by the standard (digger  derricks \nand boom trucks) and bucket trucks, which are not. (ID-0344.)  The record also indicates that journeymen are \nextensively trained in  apprenticeship programs in the use of their powered equipment, and that  the \nprimary cost of meeting the duties of the final standard is  certifying crane operators. (ID-0155.1; -0344.) The \nAgency can also  estimate based on comment in the record that there are far more digge r  derricks than \nboom trucks, in a ratio of about 85:15, based on reports  of 16 of Edison Electric's members who provided \ninformation in the  record and identified their types of equipment. The PEA in subpart V  was based on the \n2002 Economic Census. The 2007 Census shows that  employment in NAICS 221110 has fallen to 78 percent \nof the 2002 level  and employment in NAICS 221120 has fallen to 90 percent of the 2002  figure. However, \nthere was no information in the record that showed the  number of linemen or pieces of equipment had \ndeclined; so the Agency is  basing its estimate of the number of employees who would be certified  to use \nthe equipment covered under the final standard as presented in  subpart V's PEA Table 5.1. Neither of the  \naffected industry sectors has  objected to certifying operators of their truck-mounted cranes; yet if  it were \nnecessary that every lineman perform every function, that would  surely also necessitate certifying every \njourneyman as well. The Agency  concludes that it is not necessary to certify every journeyman as a  crane \noperator for the industry to continue to efficiently use their  equipment and manpower.",

The final \nbenefits analysis is based on four years'  of IMIS fatality reports, rather than BLS's Ce nsus of Fatal  \nOccupational Injuries as in the preliminary analysis, as it was not  possible to use the CFOI data to estimate \nthe number of fatalities that  were occurring due to crane construction activity by employers in  general \nindustry sectors. The Agency estimates that compliance with the  final standard will prevent 22 fatalities and \n175 non-fatal injuries  per year, compared to 53 fatalities estimated to be avoided in the PEA.     The Agency \nalso estimates that compliance will result in  considerable cost saving by preventing many more accidents that \ndo not  result in injury. The Agency has estimated that annual savings from  avoiding project delay, damage \nto cranes and structures, and lost  productivity is at least $7 million annually just from one type of  crane \naccident--tipovers. The Agency has not attempted to quantify all  of the costs avoided by all crane accidents \nprevented by the final  standard, but concludes these cost savings are also substantial. In  addition, the \nAgency has noted that a significant portion of these  benefits will be passed back immediately to employers \nin the form of  $51 million annual savings in liability insurance costs for the  affected industries.     OMB \nrequires agencies to monetize benefits where possible. The  Agency is revising its estimate of the VSL \npresented in the PEA, which  was based on an EPA estimate from the early 1990s. The VSL is estimated  to \nbe about $7 million in terms of 2000 dollars (Viscusi and Aldy,  2003). At the same time the willingness-to-pay \nto avoid serious injury  was estimated to be about $50,000. The Agency is adjusting the values  based on the \nchange in the GDP implicit price deflator from 2000 to  2010 of about 25 percent (Bureau of Economic Analysis, \n\"National  Economic Accounts,\" Table 1.1.9 at http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb).  The VSL is then $8.7 \nmillion and the monetized value of avoiding a serious,  non-fatal injury is $62,500. When fatalities and injuries \nare monetized, the  total monetized benefits of the standard from preventing crane accidents is  $202.3 \nmillion annually from those sources.      The Agency estimates that the total cost of the final standard is  \nabout $154.1 million annually. Based on comment in the record, the  Agency increased unit costs for ground \nconditions and \"controlling  entity\" duties for some sectors, crane operator certification, and  power line \ncompliance provisions. The record showed that relatively  more crane operators are already certified, and the \nAgency reduced  costs by that factor. The total estimated costs increased due to the  inclusion of some \ngeneral industry sectors which perform construction  activities, as well as increases in unit costs. The net  \nbenefit of the  standard is $55.2 million annually (total benefits of $ 209.3 million  less costs of $154.1 million \nannually).     The economic impact on affected employers, in terms of costs versus  revenues, ranged from \n0.01 percent to 0.2 percent, for an average-size  employer. When annual costs are compared to profits, \nimpacts range from  0.1 percent to 4 percent, for the average employer. Impacts were  highest for employers \nwho owned and rented cranes. The final standard  is technologically feasible f or employers as it does not \ncontain any  requirements that are not capable of being done. The Agency also  concludes that the final \nstandard is economically feasible, as the  highest impacts are on employers who own and rent cranes and \neven that  impact is no more than 4 percent. Cost and impacts of that magnitude  are far less than the typical \nyearly swings in revenues and profits for  the construction industry. Economic impacts on small business are  \npresented below in the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.",

Under paragraph (n)(6)(iii), the plan must specify the areas of the  deck where the \nmobile auxiliary crane is permitted to be positioned,  travel, and operate. It must also specify the parameters \n(that is,  limitations) of such movements and operation. For example, a section of  the plan could limit \nmovement of the mobile crane to a specified area  without a load, and to another specified area while \nhandling a load.     Under paragraph (n)(6)(iv), the employer must mark the deck to  identify the permitted \nareas for positioning, traveling, and operating  the mobile crane. This provision is necessary so that the \noperator  maneuvers and operates the crane within the permitted areas spec ified  by the plan, thereby \nensuring the stability of the vessel/flotation  device and the safety of employees.      Under paragraph \n(n)(6)(v), the plan must specify the dynamic and  environmental conditions that have to be present for the \nmobile  auxiliary crane to move and operate on the vessel. Under Sec.   1926.1437(n)(6)(v), if the specific \ndynamic and environmental  conditions are not present, the mobile auxiliary crane must be secured  \naccording to one of the four options outlined in Sec. Sec .   1926.1437(n)(5)(i) through (iv). For example, the \nplan must address  environmental conditions, such as the maximum amount of wind and wave  action \npermitted; if these conditions are exceeded, the mobile crane  must be secured using one of the four options \nspecified by Sec.   1926.1437(n)(5). While OSHA received no comments on the requirements of  this \nparagraph in the proposal, it is retaining this paragraph in the  final standard as proposed because a properly \nprepared plan will ensure  the structural integrity and stability of the vessel/flotation device,  thereby \nprotecting employees from drowning, impact, and other hazards.      Paragraph (n)(7) \\141\\ contains \nrequirements regarding the barge,  pontoon, vessel or other means of flotation on which the land crane/ \nderrick is located. The requirements Sec.  1926.1437(n)(7) are  identical to those listed at paragraph (m)(5) \nof this section. These  requirements ensure the structural capacity of the vessel/flotation  device to support \nthe land crane/derrick and the loads handled by this  equipment, as well as the stability of the vessel/flotation \ndevice.  These provisions are designed to help prevent unintended movement while  operating equipment \nand to prevent capsizing. OSHA finds these  requirements necess ary to provide a safe, stable work \nenvironment. OSHA  received no comments on this paragraph in the proposed rule. However,  as with \nparagraph (m)(5), OSHA is retaining this paragraph in the final  rule to ensure the stability of vessels/flotation \ndevices during crane/ derrick operations, thereby preventing employee exposure to drowning,  impact, and \nother hazards associated with crane/derrick operations  onboard vessels/flotation devices. -----------------------\n----------------------------------------------------      \\141\\ Formerly paragraph (n)(6) in the proposal. -------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------  Section 1926.1438 Overhead and Gantry Cranes     As defined \nin Sec.  1926.1401, overhead and gantry cranes include  overhead/bridge cranes, semigantry cranes, \ncantilever gantry cranes,  wall cranes, storage bridge cranes, launching gantry cranes, and  similar equipment, \nirrespective of whether it travels on tracks,  wheels, or other means. The Committee developed this definition \nto  reflect the wide range of this type of equipment.     Overhead and gantry cranes are commonly found \non general industry  as well as construction worksites. Sometimes overhead and gantry cranes  installed in \ngeneral industry facilities are used for construction  purposes (for example, the overhead/gantry crane in a \nfactory is  sometimes used when a part of the factory is being renovated). The  Committee determined that \napplying the general industry standard for  overhead and gantry cranes, Sec.  1910.179, to the use of those \ncranes  for construction work, rather than the requirements of new subpart CC,  would reduce compliance \nburdens without jeopardizing employee  protection.

Section 1926.1433(d)(7)(v) states that areas of the cab \nroof that  serve as a workstation for rigging, maintenance or other crane -related  tasks must be capable of \nsupporting 250 pounds without permanent  distortion.     Section 1926.1433(d)(8) requires that belts, \ngears, shafts,  pulleys, sprockets, spindles, drums, f ly wheels, chains, and other  parts or components that \nreciprocate, rotate or otherwise move be  guarded where contact by employees (except for maintenance and \nrepair  workers) is possible in the performance of normal duties. The exception  permits maintenance and \nrepair workers to remove the guards when their  work requires access to the parts being guarded.      \nSection 1926.1433(d)(9) requires that all exhaust pipes,  turbochargers, and charge air coolers be insulated or \nguarded where  contact by employee s is possible in the performance of normal duties.  As with Sec.  \n1926.1433(d)(8), an exception is provided when  maintenance and repair workers need to remove the guards \nto perform  their work. This provision is included to protect workers against  injuries that can occur if they \ncontact components that are hot enough  to cause burns.      Section 1926.1433(d)(10) requires that \nhydraulic and pneumatic  lines be protected from damage to the extent feasible. For example,  where \nhydraulic or pneumatic lines are subject to chafing from  vibration or movement of the equipment, they must \nbe secured, protected  with anti -chafing gear, or otherwise protected fro m chafing damage.  Denting, \ncrushing, puncturing, or nicking a hydraulic or pneumatic line  could adversely affect the structural integrity \nof the line and  compromise the safe operation of the affected systems and the crane as  a whole.      \nSection 1926.1433(d)(11) requires that equipment be designed so  that exhaust fumes are not discharged in \nthe cab and are discharged in  a direction away from the operator. This provision ensures that exhaust  gases \nthat are likely to adversely affect or incapacitate the operator  will not accumulate in the cab because of the \ndesign of the equipment.  For the same reason, OSHA is amending the final rule to clarify that  the exhaust \nfumes must also be discharged away from any air intake  source for the cab.     Section 1926.1433(d)(12), \nFriction mechanisms, states that where  friction mechanisms (such as brakes and clutches) are used to control  \nthe boom hoist or load line hoist, they must be: of a size and thermal  capacity sufficient to control all rated \nloads with the minimum  recommended reeving; and adjustable to permit compensation for lining  wear to \nmaintain proper operation. The words \"all rated\" have been  added back into paragraph (d)(12)(i) of this \nsection in response to  several comments who correctly pointed out that the phrase was included  in the C-\nDAC consensus document. (ID -0180.1; -0205.1; -0213.1.) This  phrase was inadvertently deleted from the \nproposal and is needed to  clarify the requirement.      Section 1926.1433(d)(13), Hydraulic load hoists, \nspecifies that  hydraulic drums have an integrally mounted holding device or internal  static brake to prevent \nload hoist movement in the event of hydraulic  failure. This requirement will protect employ ees against \nunintended  movement of the load hoist caused by a hydraulic failure.      As noted above, Sec. Sec.  \n1926.1433(d)(7)(iii)(C) and  1926.1433(d)(11) were amended to clarify those provisions, and Sec.   \n1926.1433(d)(12)(i) was amended to address c omments received. All other  provisions of paragraph (d) are \npromulgated as proposed with minor  grammatical corrections and changes in numbering.  Paragraph (e)     \nSection 1926.1433(e) permits employers to rely on documentation  from manufacturers to show that they are \nin compliance with Sec. Sec.   1926.1433(a)-(c) and 1926.1433(d)(7)-(d)(13) where the equipment has  not \nbeen modified \\131\\ since it was manufactured, except in accordance  with Sec.",

That \nunderstanding is  important to their successful implementation. Because of the critical  nature of these \nmeasures, and the seriousness of the consequences to  the safety of the employees if they are not \nimplemented correctly, the  Committee concluded that it is necessary for there to be a structured  process \nby which the employer communicates this information.      As noted below, a planning meeting to discuss \nimplementing  encroachment prevention measures is also required under Sec.   1926.1408(b)(1). Refer to \nthe preamble section rel ated to that  provision for a discussion about public comments received regarding  \nresponsibilities for ensuring that such a meeting takes place. That  discussion is equally relevant to this section. \nWith the exception of  the use of the term \"director\" instead of \"supervisor,\" as  explained above, this section \nis promulgated as proposed. Paragraph (b)(2)     Paragraph (b)(2) of this section requires that where tag lines \nare  used they must be nonconductive. This provision uses two terms that are  defined in Sec.  1926.1401. \n\"Tag lines\" is defined as \"a rope  (usually fiber) attached to a lifted load for purposes of controlling  load \nspinning and pendular motions or used to stabilize a bucket or  magnet during material handling operations.\" \nThus, one end of a tag  line is attached to the load and the other end is held by an employee  who controls \nthe load's motion by exerting force on the line.     If the equipment or load were to make electrical contact \nwith a  power line while an employee was holding a tag line that was able to  conduct electricity, the \nemployee could be electrocuted. The  requirement that the tag line be nonconductive is designed to protect  \nagainst such an event. Section 1926.1401 defines \"nonconductive\" as  meaning that, \"because of the nature \nand conditions of the materials  used, and the conditions of use (including environmental conditions and  \ncondition of the material), the object in question has the property of  not becoming energized (that is, it has \nhigh dielectric properties offering a high  resistance to the passage of current under the conditions of use).\"      \nThis definition recognizes that it is not  only the inherent  property of the tag line material that results in it \nbeing  nonconductive but also the conditions of use. For example, in some  cases, if an otherwise \nnonconductive material were to become wet and  therefore able to conduct electricity,  it would no longer \nqualify as  nonconductive under this paragraph.      One commenter requested that OSHA specify test \nprocedures to assist  employers in making the determination of whether a tag line is  nonconductive. (ID-\n0178.1.) C-DAC considered the utility of setting  specifications for materials required to be nonconductive but  \ndetermined that it would be impractical. American Society for Testing  and Materials (ASTM) Standard \nSpecification for Unused Polypropylene  Rope With Special Electrical Prope rties, ASTM F1701 -05 contains  \nspecifications and test methods for live -line rope used in electric  power work. These ropes are used to \ninsulate power line workers from  energized power lines. Tag lines meeting this standard are acceptable  \nunder the final rule. However, to meet the requirement for  \"nonconductive\" tag lines, they need not meet \nthis standard, which  requires a degree of insulation beyond that intended by t he final rule.  In addition, \nseveral other OSHA general industry and construction  standards call for nonconductive materials, including \nSec.   1910.268(n)(13)(ii) (requiring nonconductive measuring devices to  measure clearance distances from \noverhead pow er lines), Sec. Sec.   1910.269(l)(6)(i) and 1910.333(c)(8) (requiring metal articles worn by  \nemployees to be rendered nonconductive), and Sec.  1926.955(a)(8)  (requiring nonconductive tag lines). In \ngeneral these and other  standards that call for nonco nductive materials require the use of  insulating \nmaterial that does not have a voltage rating; thus, there is  no need to specify a test method. In fact, setting \ntest criteria for  these materials would produce a voltage rating and render them  insulating rather than \nnonconductive.",

In the proposed rule, OSHA \nnoted that OSHA standards did not apply  to uniformed military personnel and to civilian employees of the  \nmilitary who are engaged in uniquely milita ry equipment, systems, and  operations. Accordingly, Option (3) \nwould apply only to civilian  employees of the Defense Department and Armed Forces who are engaged in  \nwork that is not uniquely military. It does not apply to employees of  private contractors who are working \nunder contract to the military. In  the proposed rule, OSHA noted that the C -DAC document did not clearly  \nexclude such employees even though that was C -DAC's intent.     To make this point clear, OSHA is adding \nthe following  clarification to Sec.  1926.1427(d)(1): An \"employee of the U.S.  military\" is a Federal \nemployee of the Department of Defense or Armed  Forces and does not include employees of private \ncontractors. This  clarification was originally proposed in Sec.  1926.1427(m), w hich is  removed from the \nfinal rule. Two commenters supported the clarification  proposed by OSHA. (ID-0205.1; -0211.1.) Another said \nthe provision  should be clarified but did not express an opinion on whether OSHA's  proposed clarification \nshould be adopted. (ID -0122.) In the absence of  any reasons presented in opposition to the proposed \nclarification, OSHA  is retaining the clarification.      Paragraph (d)(2) specifies that qualification under \nOption (3) is  not portable. Because this option is designed specifically to  accommodate civilian employees \nof the U.S. military, and therefore is  not based on the same criteria and independent third-party  verification. \nHowever, if a U.S. military entity meets the requirements  of Option (1), OSHA would consider the operator \ncertification provided  by that entity to be portable.  Paragraph (e) Option (4): Licensing by a Government \nEntity     Paragraph (e) of this section of the final rule addresses  government licensing departments/offices \nthat issue operating licenses  for equipment covered by this standard. Paragraph (e)(1) makes it clear  that \nOSHA is only requiring compliance with State or local operating  licensing requirements when those licensing \nprograms meet the  requirements specified in paragraphs (e)(2). These requirements are  commonly \nreferred to as a \"Federal floor,\" meaning that they are the  minimum criteria necessary to trigger employer \ncompliance with those  licensing requirement under this standard. OSHA is including this \"Federal floor\"  \nbecause it determines, as did C -DAC, that some, but potentially not all, State/  local governments will have \neffective, reliable licensing procedures.  If OSHA determines that a State or local licensing department/office,  \nor its testing, does not satisfy the minimum requirements set out in  paragraphs (e) and (j), then employers \nwould not be required by OSHA to  comply with the licensing requirements of that government entity. In  \nsuch cases, the employer would satisfy the requirements of this section  by ensuring that their operators are \ncertified or qualified in  accordance with the options provided in paragraphs (b) through (d).      The \nrequirement for the government licensing department/office to  meet the criteria in Sec.  1926.1427(e)(2) \nensures that operators who  qualify under Option (4) have the requisite kn owledge and skills to  operate \nsafely. Paragraph (e)(2)(i) requires that the criteria used by  the licensing department/office address the \nknowledge and skill  requirements listed in Sec.  1926.1427(j). Section 1926.1427(e)(2)(ii)  requires that the \ngovernment entity follow the same test content, test  administration and related criteria as required under \nOption (1).  Section 1926.427(e)(2)(iii) requires that the office with authority  over the licensing \ndepartment/office assess the tests and procedures  used by the licensing office/department and determine \nthat the  requirements of Sec. Sec.  1926.1427(e)(2)(ii) and 1926.1427(e)(2)(iii)  have been met. Also, the \ngovernment licensing office must have re - certification procedures in place as discussed in Sec.  Sec.   \n1926.1427(b)(1)(iv) and 1926.427(c)(4).",

The telecommunications industry is  identified as NAICS 517110 Wired \nTelecommunications Carriers. According  to the Economic Census the telecommunications industry has about \n2,500  firms, 27,000 establishments and 634,000 employees. There are 89,000  employees in the industry \nwho are \"telecommunications line installers  and repairers\"--as opposed to the electric power industry's \njourneymen  who are \"electric power installers and repairers\" (2008 Occupationa l  Employment Survey, or \nOES). OES reports only 50 power line installers  are employed in the industry. The telecommunications \nindustry was  described in comment as engaged in work similar to that of the electric  power industry--using \ndigger derricks and radial boom trucks to install  or replace utility poles or in laying underground cable. The \nAgency  concludes that telecommunications workers are not primarily engaged in  constructing and \nreplacing structural members, but in running or  maintaining communications lines on poles or underground, \nand therefore  are far less intensely engaged in activities that require digger  derricks or cranes. In addition, \nthe industry likely also employs  construction contractors for its construction work. There is nothing in  the \nrecord to suggest that digger derricks in the telecommunications  industry are used for activities other than \nutility pole work. For  example, they would not be used to hoist tran sformers or other  moderately heavy \nequipment onto utility poles, or at substations or  other facilities, because telecommunications equipment \ndoes not consist  of such hardware. Digger derricks therefore will largely be exempt from  the final standard \nin the telecommunications industry because they do  not perform construction work in which they hoist loads \nin other  construction activities. The Agency estimates that the industry employs  about 1 truck -mounted \ncrane per firm (for a total of about 3,000), o n  average, that will be covered by the final standard.      The \nself-employed owner-operators of cranes doing construction work  would not be required under the standard \nto be certified crane  operators as they do not have employees and are themselves not  employees. The \nAgency estimates that about 5 percent of cranes are  owned and operated by the self -employed, based on \nBLS data (ID-0025).     Table B-2 summarizes the industries affected, and the number of  cranes they use. \nAs can be seen from this table,  adding the general  industry sectors in the manner outlined above results in \napproximately  35,000 additional cranes and crane operators. Table B-4 presents  information about \"small \nentity\" establishments, as defined by SBA.  Table B-5 presents information about establishments with fewer \nthan 20  employees.

Therefore, under Sec.   1926.1437(n)(1)(i), the rated \ncapacity (as depicted in the load charts)  must be reduced for list, trim, wave action, and wind.      In \nestablishing the rated capacity for use on the vessel/flotation  device, the capacity of the vessel/flotation \ndevice also must be  considered. Since some locations on the vessel/flotation device will  have less ability to \nsupport the crane/derrick than others, under Sec.   1926.1437(n)(1)(ii), the rated capacity must be applicable \nto a specified  location(s) on the vessel/flotation device. This assessment must be made  considering the \nexpected and encountered environmental conditions.     Paragraph (n)(2) specifies that the modification to \nrated capacity  required by Sec.  1926.1437(n)(1) of this s ection must be performed  either by the \nmanufacturer of the equipment or by a qualified person  with expertise in both land crane/derrick capacity \nand the stability of  vessels/flotation devices. Performance by a qualified person will  achieve equivalent \noperational safety conditions as for the modified  floating cranes/derricks. In the proposed rule, OSHA (at the \nrequest of  the SBREFA Panel) requested public comment as to whether qualified  persons are available in \nthe industry with expertise in both land   crane/derrick capacity and the stability of vessels/flotation devices  \nwith respect to equipment performing duty -cycle work (73 FR 59864, Oct.  9, 2008). Two commenters \nresponded to this inquiry by stating that  qualified persons are available in the industry with expertise in both  \nland crane/derrick capacity and stability of vessels with respect to  equipment performing duty-cycle work. \n(ID-0205.1; -0213.1.)     OSHA also requested comment from the public on whether the  requirements of \n(n)(2) are neces sary for the safety of employees when  equipment is engaged in duty cycle work. Two \ncommenters found that  these requirements are necessary for safety when equipment is engaged  in duty \ncycle work. (ID-0205.1; -0213.1.) Another commenter supported  this position by noting instances when the \ninput of a qualified person  is needed since the list and trim of the vessel can affect the rated  capacity of the \nequipment. (ID -0345.26.) Based on these comments, and  the employee protection afforded by the \nrequirements of paragraph  (n)(2), OSHA is including these requirements in the final rule as  proposed.     \nParagraph (n)(3) sets parameters for the maximum allowable list and  trim for the vessel/flotation device and \nthe land crane/derrick to  ensure vessel and crane/derrick stability and to prevent the crane/  derrick from \nexceeding its rated capacity. Under paragraph (n)(4), when  a land crane/derrick is used on a flotation device, \nall deck surfaces  must be above water and the entire bottom area must be submerged. This  provision is \nnecessary to ensure a stable platform when operating the  land crane/derrick, to protect against loads that \nwould cause the  system used to secure the land crane/derrick (see Sec.   1926.1437(n)(5)) to fail, and to \nprotect against overloading the  vessel/flotation device land/crane derrick.     Even though OSHA received \nno comments on these two paragraphs, it  is retaining the paragraphs in the final  rule because maintaining  \nproper list and trim, as well as buoyancy, is critical to the stability  of the vessel/flotation device, which will \nprevent the vessel/flotation  device from capsizing and endangering employees.      Paragraph (n)(5) sets \nforth four options for securing \\139\\ the  land crane/derrick on the vessel/flotation device. Providing several  \noptions to employers addresses the various of work scenarios found in  the industry. Each option is effective \nin preventing the land crane/ derrick from rolling, sliding, or in any way shifting away from its  proper location. \nThese horizontal movements can cause the vessel/  flotation device to become unstable, or the land \ncrane/derrick to slide  or fall into the water. Additionally, OSHA determines that an exception  is appropriate \nfor use of mobile auxiliary cranes on a vessel. The  requirements for this type of equipment are specified by \nSec.   1926.1437(n)(5)(vi).",

The Agency concludes it is important to state \nexplicitly that  the qualified person conducting these inspections must have the  necessary expertise for the \nitems listed for the annual inspection with  respect to barges, pontoons, vessels or other means of flotation.  \nAccordingly, OSHA is retaining the provision in the final rule.      The qualified person required for the shift \nand monthly inspections  must have expertise with respect to the work conditions, the crane/ derrick, and the \nvessel/flotation device. However, the annual  inspection is more extensive than the shift or monthly \ninspections. The  qualified person for the annual inspection must have a greater level of  expertise than the",

OSHA agrees that specifying an overly -detailed procedure to \naddress  this hazard would be inappropriate given the myriad of circumstances in  which this issue may arise. \nHowever, the Agency also determined that  the proposed rule's regulatory text did not identify the purpose \nof the  provision with sufficient clarity. Therefore, the final standard does  not specify that the test has to be \nperformed at a certain time that is  tied to the installation of any particular section, but instead  requires a \ntest whenever the A/D director will be relying on the boom  hoist brake to function properly. In short, the test \nneeds to be  performed, prior to reliance being placed on the brake, and the test  needs to accurately \naccount for the loads that will be placed on the  brake. The provision in the final rule, therefore, requires the \nboom  hoist brake to be tested prior to each time reliance on the boom hoist  brake is anticipated.

A labor representative urged OSHA to require a minimum clearance  distance of 20 feet \nrather than the lower clearance distances allowed  under Table A, in essence eliminating Option (3).

The 20 - foot clearance is needed because, in the com menter's view, under the  options in the \nproposal, crane operations can easily encroach on an  absolute safe distance from power lines.

No comments were received on this provision. It is promulgated as  proposed \nexcept for one grammatical correction. Paragraph (h) Addressing Specific Hazards     Section 1926.1404(h) \nrequires that the A/D director supervising the  assembly/disassembly operation address known hazards \nassociated with  the operation with methods to protect the employees from them, and  provides a list of \nspecific hazards that are likely to cause serious  injury or death. The A/D director must consider each hazard, \ndetermine  the appropriate means of addressing it, and oversee the implementation  of that method.      \nNo comments were received on this provision. It is promulgated as  proposed with a grammatical clarification \nand the addition of the words  \"which include\" at the end of the introductory language to  acknowledge the \nemployer's existing responsibility under Sec.  5(a)(1)  of the OSH Act (the \"general duty clause\") to address \nother  recognized hazards not listed in this paragraph.  Paragraph (h)(1) Site and Ground Bearing Conditions      \nThis provision works in conjunction with Sec.  1926.1402, which  addresses ground conditions for both \nassembly/disassembly and use of  the equipment, i ncluding ground condition criteria. Section  \n1926.1404(h)(1) requires the A/D director to assess the ground  conditions for conformance with those \ncriteria, and to assess the site  for suitability for assembly and disassembly. (See the discussion of  this \nprovision at 73 FR 59744, Oct. 9, 2008.) No comments were received  on this provision; it is promulgated as \nproposed.  Paragraphs (h)(2) Blocking Material and (h)(3) Proper Location of  Blocking     These two \nprovisions address the hazards associated with inadequate  blocking. Section 1926.1404(h)(2) requires the \nsize, amount, condition  and method of stacking the blocking to be sufficient to sustain the  loads and \nmaintain stability. Section 1926.1404(h)(3) requires that  when used to support booms or comp onents, \nblocking must be  appropriately placed to protect the structural integrity of the  equipment, and prevent \ndangerous movement and collapse.      \"Blocking\" (also referred to as \"cribbing\") is defined in Sec.   \n1926.1401 as \"wood or other material use d to support equipment or a  component and distribute loads to \nthe ground. Typically used to support  latticed boom sections during assembly/disassembly and under \noutrigger  floats.\" This definition is from A Glossary of Common Crane and  Rigging Terms, a publication by \nthe Specialized Carriers & Rigging  Foundation (\"SC&RF Handbook\"). (ID-0035.)     Proper blocking plays an \nimportant role in assembly/disassembly  safety by reducing the risk of injuries from unplanned movement or \nthe  collapse of equipment. (See the discussion of blocking at 73 FR 59744,  Oct. 9, 2008.)      One \ncommenter suggested including a strength requirement for  blocking. (ID-0053.1.) OSHA determines that the \nprovision as proposed,  which requires that the \"size, amount, condition and method of  stacking blocking \nmust be sufficient to sustain the loads and maintain  stability,\" appropriately addresses blocking strength. \nTherefore, OSHA  has not made a change to the wording of the provision in this regard.      The version of \nparagraph (h)(3) in the proposed rule was applicable  only to lattice booms and components. In the proposed \nrule's preamble,  OSHA asked for public comment on whether the provision should also  apply to other types \nof booms and components (i.e., those for hydraulic  cranes). (See the discussion of this provision at 73 FR \n59745, Oct. 9,  2008.)     Several commenters stated that proper blocking is necessary for  hydraulic \ncranes in addition to lattice boom cranes. (ID -0213.1; - 0205.1; -0118.1.) In addition, hearing testimony also \nindicated that  there is a need for this requirement to apply to hydraulic cranes  because they are sometimes \nassembled or disassembled, at least  partially, in the field. (See ID-0343.1.)     OSHA has concluded that the \nrequirement is necessary for both  hydraulic and lattice boom cranes and components.",

As explained below in the  \ndiscussion of Sec.  1926.1435(b)(5), the crane's tower must be plumb to  the manufacturer's tolerance or, \nwhere the manufacturer does not  specify the plumb tolerance, plumbed to a tolerance of at least 1:500.      \nOSHA concludes that adding the words \"or near vertical\" to the  definition of tower crane is not necessary. \nAlthough a tower crane may  deviate from being perfectly vertical by the amount of the  manufacturer's \ntolerance or, where the manufacturer does not specify a  tolerance, at least 1:500, the tower crane would still \nbe \"vertical\"  within the ordinary meaning of that word. Adding the words \"or near  vertical\" could create \nadditional ambiguity and is not necessary to  avoid misleading tower crane us ers into thinking that their \nequipment  does not fall within OSHA's definition if the tower deviates from  perfect vertical by the amount \npermitted by the rule.      Two commenters suggested adding the following sentence at the end  of the \ndefinition:      Mobile cranes that are configured with luffing jib and/or tower  attachments are not",

In addition, \nOSHA has drafted the exclusion in the final rule so  that it is based on the type of work done with the digger \nderrick,  rather than the industry classification of the employer performin g the  work. For example, digger \nderricks used by a railroad to install poles  for telecommunication lines would be excluded.     When digger \nderricks are used in the operation and maintenance of  existing electric power lines, they are subject to the \ngeneral industry  standard at Sec.  1910.269. OSHA is currently conducting another  rulemaking designed \nto avoid inconsistencies between subpart V of the  construction standards, which applies to power line \nconstruction work,  and Sec.  1910.269 (see 70 FR 348 21, Jun. 15, 2005). Pending the  completion of that \nrulemaking, digger derricks excluded from this rule  will be subject to the same requirements regardless of \nwhether they are  used for work subject to subpart V or work subject to Sec.  1910.269.  To ensure that \ndigger derricks excluded from this rule (Subpart CC) are  subject to appropriate safety requirements, OSHA is \nincluding language  in Sec.  1926.1400(c)(4), and is amending subpart V, to explicitly  state that the \nactivities from which digger derricks are excluded from  subpart CC are subject to applicable provisions of Sec.  \n1910.269.  Those rules include Sec.  1910.269(p) (mechanical equipment), Sec.   1910.269(a)(2) (training), \nand Sec.  1910.269(l) (work on or near  exposed energized parts).      Similarly, digger derricks used in \ngeneral industry  telecommunication work are subject to the general industry standard at  Sec.  1910.268. \nSection 1910.268 includes requirements for working near  energized power lines and requirements pertaining \nto the o peration of  the equipment, such as the need to comply with manufacturer load  ratings. The \nrequirements applicable to digger derricks under the  general industry telecommunications standard (Sec.  \n1910.268) are  comparable to those in the general industry electric utility standard  (Sec.  1910.269). \nAccordingly, to ensure that comparable safety  requirements apply to digger derricks during pole work, OSHA \nis  including language in final Sec.  1926.1400(c)(4) stating that Sec.   1910.268 applies when digger \nderricks are used in construction work for  telecommunication service. Section 1910.268 includes \nrequirements for  working near energized power lines and requirements pertaining to the  operation of the \nequipment, such as the need to comply with  manufacturer load ratings.      In addition, Sec.  \n1926.952(c)(2) is also being amended to conform  subpart V to Sec.  1926.1400(c)(4).      While OSHA \nagrees that the limited exclusion recommended by C-DAC  should be broadened in this manner, the Agency \ndoes not agree that the  exclusion should encompass all uses of digger derricks in electric  utility construction \nwork, as some commenters suggested. Digger  derricks are specifically designed to be used to install and \nremove  utility poles. However, their lifting ability is not limited to utility  poles, and the record shows that \nthey are used by electric utilities  for general lifting work, such as setting t ransformers in substations.      \nTheir use with utility poles falls within the \"narrow, specialized  range of activities and circumstances\" that led \nC-DAC to develop the  proposed exclusion (see 73 FR 59729, Oct. 9, 2008). But when digger  derricks are \nused for general lifting purposes, the hazards are the  same as when other equipment of similar capacity is \nused for general  lifting, and the exclusion developed by C -DAC is not appropriate for  such work.",
    "73251b3d-e339-4dff-89ea-42aca48c82e8": "page_label: 119\nfile_name: OSHA-Final Rule-Cleaned.pdf\nfile_path: C:\\Users\\bs44876\\Desktop\\Project\\CII-Crane\\FineEmb\\dataset\\data\\OSHA-Final Rule-Cleaned.pdf\nfile_type: application/pdf\nfile_size: 3496317\ncreation_date: 2025-01-07\nlast_modified_date: 2025-01-07\n\nOSHA notes that Sec.  1926.1412(f) does not specify the level of  scrutiny for the annual/comprehensive \ninspection. In drafting the  proposed rule, OHSA determined that C-DAC intended for this inspection  to be \nmore thorough than the visual inspection for apparent  deficiencies required of the shift and monthly \ninspections. OSHA  therefore solicited comments from the public as to whether language  specifying a higher \nlevel of scrutiny (for example, \"thorough,  including disassembly when necessary\") should be added.     A \nrailroad equipment supplier commented that this section does not  additionally burden employers if it \nrequires them to open covers to  inspect for safety defects that could cause an incident or death. (ID- 0124.) \nTherefore, they were in support of adding stronger language to  paragraph (f) of this section to emphasize \nsome disassembly is  necessary to complete a thorough inspection of the equipment. In  contrast, two trade \nassociations believed that no additional language  was need in the regulatory text to specify that a higher level \nof  scrutiny is needed during an annual inspection. (ID -0205.1; -0213.)     OSHA determines that some \ndisassembly of the equipment will be  needed for the qualified person to complete the inspection. Therefore,  \nOSHA has revised Sec.  1926.1412(f)(2) accordingly.      The proposed rule did not require the individual \nwho conducts the  annual inspection to review any documentation related to the crane  prior to or during \nthe inspection. A labor representative suggested two  types of documentation they believe the qualified \nperson should review  when conducting an annual inspection. (ID -0182.1.) First, the commenter  wanted \nOSHA to include a requirement in paragraph (f) of this section  that the inspector contact the manufacturer \nfor any relevant  information the manufacturer may have about the equipment. The  commenter explains \nthat the manufacture r may have information about  recently discovered defects or deficiencies in the \nequipment or have  recommended modification, which inspectors should take into account  when \nperforming the annual inspection.      Second, the commenter recommended that OSHA require the \ninspector  to review all available information regarding the history of the piece  of equipment. This \ninformation would include annual or periodic  inspection reports, which would describe previously discovered \ndefects  or previously made modifications, to which the inspector should pay  particular attention while \nconducting a comprehensive inspection. OSHA  declines to impose the requirements suggested by the \ncommenter because  the Agency does not  agree they would lead to better inspections. The  annual \ninspection requirements are designed to ensure that the  inspector thoroughly scrutinizes and evaluates the \ncurrent condition of  critical components of the equipment. Reviewing the maintenance hist ory  of the \nequipment will not further the value of this inspection, for  defects previously discovered should have been \nrepaired and defects not  present in the past may now exist. For example, if a part such as a  ball bearing is \nreplaced with a new part , there is no reason to expect  that the bearing will fail. To the contrary, the brand \nnew part is less  likely to fail than another ball bearing that has been subjected to  heavy use for years. OSHA \ndetermines that the inspection will be more  valuable if the inspector concentrates on thoroughly inspecting \nthe  items listed in the rule to determine whether they currently present  any safety defects. Similarly, OSHA \nis not convinced that contacting  the manufacturer will yield valuable information that will  advance the  \nannual inspection. OSHA determines that important safety information  about their products is provided \nvoluntarily by manufacturers to their  customers and that a requirement to contact them each year is not  \nlikely to yield any further information of value.     Paragraphs (f)(2)(i) through (xxi) specify the parts of the  \nequipment and the conditions the inspector must look for during the  annual inspection. The Committee \ndeveloped this list based on the  members' experience and current industry practice as reflected in  current \nconsensus standards for annual/periodic inspections. The  Committee concluded that each item plays an",

For example, two-block protection, which is  required by \nsec. 5-1.9.9.1 of the ASME standard, is addressed in Sec.   1926.1416 of this proposed standard. In addition, \nthe issues addressed  in paragraph (e) below are addressed in ASME B30.5 -2004 but, instead of  making \nthose provisions applicable solely to mobile and locomotive  cranes, C-DAC drafted corresponding provisions \nthat would be applied to  all of the equipment subject to this proposed standard.     The sections of ASME \nB30.5 referenced in Sec. Sec.  1926.1433(b)(1)  and (b)(13) contain requirements for e quipment with \noutriggers  partially extended that are not found in the earlier version of the  ASME standard. In the \ndiscussion of Sec.  1926.1433(b) of the proposed  rule, OSHA noted that Sec.  1926.1404(q)(1) permits \npartial deployment  of outriggers when manufacturer procedures permit, and expressed its  conclusion that \nincorporating the provisions on partially deployed  outriggers in the 2004 version of ASME B30.5 would be \nconsistent with  Sec.  1926.1404(q)(1). OSHA requested public comment on this iss ue. In  response, one \ncommenter recommended requiring a system or device that  would sense the positions of the outriggers and \ninteract with the  crane's onboard computer system (LMI, RCL, etc.) to automatically  reduce the crane's \ncapacity based on the outrigger positions. (ID- 0131.1.) Although this might well be a desirable addition, OSHA \ncannot  find evidence in this rulemaking record to indicate that such a system/  device is currently available \nand feasible. The Agency therefore  declines to add such a requirement.  Paragraph (c)     Proposed \nparagraph (c) of this section, Prototype testing, required  that mobile (including crawler and truck) and \nlocomotive cranes  manufactured on or after the effective date of this standard meet the  prototype testing \nrequirements in Sec.  1926.1433(c)(1), Test Option A  or Sec.  1926.1433(c)(2), Test Option B of this section. \nTest Option A  continues the prototype testing methodology that was previously  required under subpart N \nfor crawler, locomotive, and truck cranes  through the incorporation of ANSI B30.5 -1968. Test Option B \npermits, as  an alternative, the use of computer modeling technology for prototype  evaluation. C-DAC \nagreed to allow computer modeling testing under the  European CEN standard only on the condition that the \nrequirements of  proposed Sec.  1926.1433(c)(2), discussed below, are met to ensure the  reliability of the \ncomputer modeling. OSHA is incorporating this option  into the final rule with the same condition. OSHA has \nupdated the  reference to the CEN standard to BS EN 13000:2004. This change was made  because for \npurposes of incorporation by reference OSHA must point to a  specific document and OSHA has selected the \nEnglish language version of  EN 13000. In addition, for clarity, a note to paragraph (c) states that  prototype \ntesting of crawler, locomotive and truck cranes manufactured  prior to the effective date of the standard must \nconform to paragraph  (a). No comments were received on the provisions of paragraph (c) that  apply to \nmobile cranes.     OSHA noted in the proposal that neither proposed Sec.  1926.1433(c)  nor any other \nproposed provisions would apply prototype testing  requirements to tower cranes. It appeared to the Agency \nthat this was  an oversight on the part of C-DAC. OSHA requested public comment on  whether there should \nbe prototype testing requirements for tower  cranes, and, if so, what requirements should apply. All four \ncommenters  on this issue recommended inclusion of computer modeling and/or  verification for tower \ncrane prototypes in accordance with BS EN  14439:2006. (ID-0156.1; -0180.1; -0205.1; -0213.1.) OSHA agrees \nwith  these comments and has added these requirements to the final version  of Sec.  1926.1433(c).",

The temporary alternatives listed in the proposed  rule instruct the operator to \ndo manually what the operational aids are  supposed to do automatically but do not assist the operator in \ncarrying  out this function. Because the temporary alternatives specified in the  proposed rule did not meet \nthe usual criteria for temporary alternative  measures, the Agency requested public comment on whether \nthere are any  alternative measures that could be used to assist the operators if  these deceleration devices \nmalfunction.     Four commenters stated there are no temporary alternative measures  for these devices. \n(ID-0172.1; -0180.1; -0205.1; -0213.1.) No  commenters suggested that there are available measures.     As \nneither C-DAC nor public commenters have been able to identify  appropriate temporary alternative measures, \nOSHA has considered whether  to continue to characterize these devices as operational aids or to  treat them \nas safety devices and prohibit operation of the equipment  unless they are working properly. OSHA has also \nconsidered whether to  retain them as Category II operational aids, which must be repaired  within 30 days, \nor to change them to Category I operational aids, which  must be repaired within 7 days. OSHA has decided \nto retain them as  Category II operational aids but to modify the temporary alternative  from that in the \nproposed rule to ensure that the operator is able to  operate the crane safely even if a deceleration device is \nnot working.     As noted above, the proposed rule specified as a \"temporary  alternative measure\" that \nthe operator reduce speed when approaching a  limit (such as a trolley's end limit) if a deceleration device is \nnot  working properly. In fact, reducing the speed near a limit is a work  practice that crane operators \ngenerally follow even if the deceleration  devices are working properly because serious damage, such as the \nload  falling, can result if a deceleration device should fail suddenly while  the component is moving too fast \nat the end of its travel. The  deceleration devices serve as backup devices that slow down the  components \nin the event the operator fails to do so properly, but  operator control is the primary means of slowing the \ntrolley, boom  hoist, and load hoist before they reach the end of their travel.      As noted above, OSHA is \nretaining C -DAC's characteri zation of these  deceleration devices as Category II operational aids. C -DAC \ndetermined  that the crane could be operated safely if the deceleration devices  were malfunctioning as long \nas the operator follows the normal practice  of manually slowing the trolley, boom hoist, and load hoist when \nthey  are near the end of their travel. No commenter or witness suggested that  a different characterization \nwas proper.     To address operations when the deceleration device is  malfunctioning, OSHA is requiring \nthe employer to make sure that the  operator is aware of the malfunctioning deceleration device and of the  \nneed to take extra care when the component is near the end of its  travel, instead of requiring the temporary \nalternative measures listed  in the proposed rule. OSHA is therefore specifying, in the final rule,  that as a \ntemporary alternative measure for each deceleration device,  the employer must post a notice in the cab of \nthe crane notifying the  operator that the device in question is malfunctioning and instructing  the operator \nto reduce speed when approaching a limit corresponding to  the malfunctioning device. OSHA concludes that \nan operator who knows  that the deceleration device is not working properly will take the  extra care needed \nto ensure that the component is moving at a safe  speed. OSHA modified paragraphs (e)(6)(ii)--(iv) in the final \nrule  accordingly.     Paragraph (e)(6)(v) requires tower cranes to have a device that  displays the wind \nspeed, mounted above the upper rotating structure. On  self erecting tower cranes, which typically rotate at \nthe tower base  and do not have an \"upper rotating superstructure,\" it would have to  be mounted at or \nabove the jib level to be in a position to give a  useful reading.
